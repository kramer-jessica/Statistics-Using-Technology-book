Mostly that chapter focused on the binomial experiment. There are many other experiments from discrete random variables that exist but are not covered in this book.\n\nChapter 6 deals with probability distributions that arise from continuous random variables. The focus of this chapter is a distribution known as the normal distribution, though realize that there are many other distributions that exist. A few others are examined in future chapters.\n\nLooking at the density plot of a quantitative variable, one can guess what the distribution of that variable is. As an example, consider the NHANES data frame. One variable to consider is Weight. The density plot of Weight is\n\n```{r NHANES6-density}\n#| fig-alt: \"Density plot of a person's weight. Appears to be symmetric, and maybe bell shaped\"\n#| warning: FALSE\n#| echo: FALSE\n#| label: fig-density-cap\n#| fig-cap: \"Density plot of the Weight of a Person\"\ngf_density(~Weight, data=NHANES, title=\"Weight of a Person\", xlab=\"Weight\")\n```\n\n@fig-density-cap looks somewhat symmetric, and maybe bell shaped.\n\nConsider, the variable head circumference (HeadCirc) in the NHANES data frame. The density plot for this variable is @fig-HeadCirc-density\n\n```{r headcirc6-density}\n#| fig-alt: \"Density plot of head circumference of a person. Appears to be skewed left.\"\n#| warning: FALSE\n#| label: fig-HeadCirc-density\n#| echo: FALSE\n#| fig-cap: \"Density plot of head circumference of a person\"\ngf_density(~HeadCirc, data=NHANES, title=\"Head Circumference of a Person\", xlab = \"Head Cicumference\")\n```\n\n@fig-HeadCirc-density looks somewhat skewed left.\n\nNow consider the variable BMI from the NHANES data frame. The density plot is\n\n```{r NHANES6a-density}\n#| fig-alt: \"Density plot of BMI of a person that is skewed right.\"\n#| warning: FALSE\n#| echo: FALSE\n#| label: fig-BMI-density\n#| fig-cap: \"Density Plot of BMI of a Person\"\ngf_density(~BMI, data=NHANES, title = \"BMI of a Person\", xlab=\"Body Mass Index\")\n```\n\nThis density plot @fig-BMI-density appears to be skewed right\n\nNow consider the variable SmokeAge. Its density plot is @fig-Smoking-density\n\n```{r NHANES6b-density}\n#| fig-alt: \"Density plot of age when a person started smoking. Appears to be bimodal.\"\n#| warning: FALSE\n#| echo: FALSE\n#| label: fig-Smoking-density\n#| fig-cap: \"Density Plot of Age when Person Started Smoking\"\ngf_density(~SmokeAge, data=NHANES, title=\"Age when a Person Started Smoking\", xlab=\"Age\")\n```\n\nThis distribution appears to be bimodal.\n\nlastly, consider the variable Pulse. The density plot is @fig-Pulse-density\n\n```{r NHANES6c-density}\n#| fig-alt: \"Density plot of pulse rate of a person. Appears to be symmetric.\"\n#| warning: FALSE\n#| echo: FALSE\n#| label: fig-Pulse-density\n#| fig-cap: \"Density Plot of Pulse Rate of a person\"\ngf_density(~Pulse, data=NHANES, title = \"Pulse Rate of a Person\", xlab=\"Pulse\")\n```\n\nThis density plot appears to be symmetric and could almost be considered bell shaped.\n\nThe reason that one considers the density plots to understand the distribution of the population, is that in some cases the distribution can be approximated with a known distribution that has certain properties. There are many known distribution. Some examples are the Uniform distribution, the Chi-Squared distribution, the Student's T distribution, and the normal distribution. The normal distribution is one of the more common distributions to use as a model, and it will be explored in this chapter. But do realize that there are many other distributions that one can use.\n\n\nMany populations have a distribution that is a symmetric, unimodal, and bell-shaped. For example: height, blood pressure, and cholesterol level. However, not every bell shaped curve is a normal curve. In a normal curve, there is a specific relationship between its \"height\" and its \"width.\" Normal curves can be tall and skinny or they can be short and fat. They are all symmetric, unimodal, and centered at $\\mu$, the population mean.\n\n@fig-normal-curvea and @fig-normal-curveb show two different normal curves drawn on the same scale. Both have $\\mu=2$ but the one in @fig-normal-curvea has a standard deviation of 1 and the one in @fig-normal-curveb has a standard deviation of 4. Notice that the larger standard deviation makes the graph wider (more spread out) and shorter.\n\n```{r normal-curvea}\n#| fig-alt: \"Bell curve with mean 2 and standard deviation of 1\"\n#| warning: FALSE\n#| echo: FALSE\n#| label: fig-normal-curvea\n#| fig-cap: \"Normal curve with mean 2 and standard deviation 1\"\ncord.x <- c(-2, seq(-2, 7, .1),-1) \ncord.y <- c(0,dnorm(seq(-2, 7, .1), 2, 1),0) \ncurve(dnorm(x, 2, 1),xlim=c(2-3*4,2+3*4)) \npolygon(cord.x,cord.y)\n```\n\n```{r normal-curveb}\n#| fig-alt: \"Bell curve with mean 2 and standard deviation of 4\"\n#| warning: FALSE\n#| echo: FALSE\n#| label: fig-normal-curveb\n#| fig-cap: \"Normal curve with mean 2 and standard deviation 4\"\ncord.x <- c(-10, seq(-10, 15, .1),-1) \ncord.y <- c(0,dnorm(seq(-10, 15, .1), 2, 4),0) \ncurve(dnorm(x, 2, 4),xlim=c(2-3*4,2+3*4), ylim=c(0,0.4)) \npolygon(cord.x,cord.y) \n```\n\nEvery normal curve has common features.\n\n-   The center, or the highest point, is at the population mean, $\\mu$.\n-   The transition points are the places where the curve changes from a \"hill\" to a \"valley\". The distance from the mean to the transition point is one standard deviation.\n-   The area under the whole curve is exactly 1. Therefore, the area under the half below or above the mean is 0.5.\n\nJust as in a discrete probability distribution, the object is to find the probability of an event occurring. However, unlike in a discrete probability distribution where the event can be a single value, in a continuous probability distribution the event must be a range. You are interested in finding the probability of $x$ occurring in the range between $a$ and $b$, or $P(a \\le x \\le b) = P(a<x<b)$. Calculus tells us this probability is the area under the curve in the interval from $a$ to $b$.\n\nBefore looking at the process for finding the probabilities under the normal curve, it is somewhat useful to look at the **Empirical Rule** that gives approximate values for these areas. The Empirical Rule is just an approximation and it will only be used in this section to give you an idea of what the size of the probabilities is for different shadings. A more precise method for finding probabilities for the normal curve will be demonstrated in the next section. Please do not use the empirical rule except for real rough estimates.\n\n**The Empirical Rule** for any normal distribution: Approximately 68% of the data is within one standard deviation of the mean. Approximately 95% of the data is within two standard deviations of the mean. Approximately 99.7% of the data is within three standard deviations of the mean.\n\n![Empirical Rule Graph](Empirical_rule.png){fig-alt=\"Empirical Rule graph with 68% of data between -1 and 1 standard deviation of mean, 95% between -2 and 2, and 99.7% between -3 and 3\"}\n\nBe careful, there is still some area left over in each end. Remember, the maximum a probability can be is 100%, so if you calculate you will see that for both ends together there is 0.3% of the curve. Because of symmetry, you can divide this equally between both ends and find that there is 0.15% in each tail beyond the 3rd standard deviations.\n\n## Finding Probabilities for the Normal Distribution\n\nThe Empirical Rule is just an approximation and only works for certain values. What if you want to find the probability for $x$ values that are not integer multiples of the standard deviation? The probability is the area under the curve. To find areas under the curve, you need calculus. Before technology, you needed to convert every $x$ value to a standardized number, called the $z$-score or $z$-value or simply just $z$. The $z$-score is a measure of how many standard deviations an $x$ value is from the mean. To convert from a normally distributed $x$ value to a $z$-score, you use the following formula.\n\n$z-score=\\frac{x-\\mu}{\\sigma}$\n\nwhere $\\mu$ = mean of the population of the $x$ value and $\\sigma$ = standard deviation for the population of the $x$ value\n\nThe $z$-score is normally distributed, with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. It is known as the standard normal curve. The $z$-score is a measure of how many standard deviations a data value is from its mean. If the $z$ - score is positive, the data value is above the mean. If the $z$-score is negative, the data value is below the mean. The farther the $z$-value is from 0, the farther the data value is from the mean.\n\nThese days technology can find probabilities without converting to the $z$-score and looking the probabilities up in a table. There are many programs available that will calculate the probability for a normal curve. The command on r to find the area to the left $P(x<value)$ is\n\npnorm(value, mean, standard_deviation, lower.tail=TRUE)\n\nThe command on r to find the area to the right, $P(x>value)$ is\n\npnorm(value, mean, standard_deviation, lower.tail=FALSE)\n\n### Example: General Normal Distribution\n\nThe length of a human pregnancy is normally distributed with a mean of 272 days with a standard deviation of 9 days (Bhat & Kushtagi, 2006).\n\na.  State the random variable\nb.  Find the probability of a pregnancy lasting more than 280 days.\nc.  Find the probability of a pregnancy lasting less than 250 days.\nd.  Find the probability that a pregnancy lasts between 265 and 280 days.\ne.  Find the length of pregnancy that 10% of all pregnancies last less than.\nf.  Suppose you meet a woman who says that she was pregnant for less than 250 days. Would this be unusual and what might you think?\n\n#### **Solution**\n\na.  State the random variable.\n\n$x$ = length of a human pregnancy\n\nb.  Find the probability of a pregnancy lasting more than 280 days.\n\nFirst translate the statement into a mathematical statement. $P(x>280)$\n\nNow, draw a picture @fig-normal-curve61.\n\n```{r normal-curve61}\n#| fig-alt: \"Density plot of pregnancy length.

The command in rStudio is\n\n```{r pnorm6d}\npnorm(280, 272, 9, lower.tail=FALSE)\n```\n\nThus 18.7% of all pregnancies last more than 280 days. This is not unusual since the probability is greater than 5%.\n\nc.  Find the probability of a pregnancy lasting less than 250 days.\n\nFirst translate the statement into a mathematical statement. $P(x<250)$\n\nNow, draw a picture @fig-normal-curve62.\n\n```{r normal-curve62}\n#| fig-alt: \"Density plot of pregnancy length.

The command in r Studio is\n\n```{r pnorm6f}\npnorm(250, 272, 9, lower.tail=TRUE)\n```\n\nThus 0.73% of all pregnancies last less than 250 days. This is unusual since the probability is less than 5%.\n\nd.  Find the probability that a pregnancy lasts between 265 and 280 days.\n\nFirst translate the statement into a mathematical statement. $P(265<x<280)$\n\nNow draw a picture @fig-normal-curve63.\n\n```{r normal-curve63, echo=FALSE, fig.cap=\"(ref:normal-curve63-cap)\", fig.alt=\"Density plot of pregnancy length.

To find the area between two values on the normal distribution, first, find the area to the left of the lower value, Graphically, this looks like @fig-normal-curve-preg\n\n```{r normal-curve-preg}\n#| fig-alt: \"Density plot of pregnancy length.

In rStudio, the way to find the probability the probability of a pregnancy lasting between 265 days and 280 days, $P(265<x<280)=0.595$ use the following command\n\n```{r pnorm6g}\npnorm(280, 272, 9, lower.tail=TRUE)-pnorm(265, 272, 9, lower.tail=TRUE) \n```\n\nThus 59.5% of all pregnancies last between 265 and 280 days.\n\ne.  Find the length of pregnancy that 10% of all pregnancies last less than.\n\nThis problem is asking you to find an $x$ value from a probability. You want to find the $x$ value that has 10% of the length of pregnancies to the left of it. In this case, you are given the probability. In r, the command is\n\nqnorm(area, mean, standard_deviation, lower.tail=TRUE or FALSE)\n\nFor this example since you know the area in the lower tail, then use lower.tail=TRUE. So the command is\n\n```{r qnorm6}\nqnorm(0.1, 272, 9, lower.tail = TRUE)\n```\n\nThus 10% of all pregnancies last less than approximately 260 days.\n\nf.  Suppose you meet a woman who says that she was pregnant for less than 250 days. Would this be unusual and what might you think?\n\nFrom part (c) you found the probability that a pregnancy lasts less than 250 days is 0.73%. Since this is less than 5%, it is very unusual. You would think that either the woman had a premature baby, or that she may be wrong about when she actually became pregnant.\n\n### Example: General Normal Distribution\n\nThe mean mathematics SAT score in 2012 was 514 with a standard deviation of 117 (\"Total group profile,\" 2012).

One way is to take a sample and look at the sample to determine if it appears normal. If the sample looks normal, then most likely the population is also. Here are some guidelines that are use to help make that determination.\n\n1.  **Density Plot**: Make a density plot. For a normal distribution, the density plot should be roughly bell-shaped. For small samples, this is not very accurate, and another method is needed. A distribution may not look normally distributed from the density plot, but it still may be normally distributed.\n\n2.  **Normal quantile plot (or normal probability plot)**: This plot is provided through statistical software on a computer. If the points lie close to a line, the data comes from a distribution that is approximately normally distributed. If the points do not lie close to a line or they show a pattern that is not a line, the data are likely to come from a distribution that is not normally distributed.\n\n### **To create a density plot on rStudio:**\n\nRead the Data Frame into r Studio. The command for density is\n\ngf_density(\\~variable, data=Data_Frame)\n\nSee chapter 2 for more examples of this.\n\n### **To create a normal quantile plot on rStudio**\n\nRead the Data Frame into rStudio. The command for normal quantile plot is\n\ngf_qqnorm(\\~variable, data=Data_Frame)\n\nRealize that your random variable may be normally distributed, even if the sample fails the two tests. However, if the density plot definitely doesn't look symmetric and bell shaped, and the normal probability plot doesn't look linear, then you can be fairly confident that the data set does not come from a population that is normally distributed.\n\n### Example: Is It Normal?\n\nIn Kiama, NSW, Australia, there is a blowhole. The data in @tbl-Eruption are times in seconds between eruptions (\"Kiama blowhole eruptions,\" 2013). Do the data come from a population that is normally distributed?\n\n```{r eruption6-data}\n#| tbl-alt: \"Time (in Seconds) Between Kiama Blowhole Eruptions\"\n#| label: tbl-Eruption\n#| tbl-cap: \"Time (in Seconds) Between Kiama Blowhole Eruptions\"\nEruption<-read.csv( \"https://krkozak.github.io/MAT160/Blowhole_eruptions.csv\") \nknitr::kable(head(Eruption))\n```\n\n**Code book for Data Frame Eruption**\n\n**Description** The ocean swell produces spectacular eruptions of water through a hole in the cliff at Kiama, about 120km south of Sydney, known as the Blowhole. The times at which 65 successive eruptions occurred from 1340 hours on 12 July 1998 were observed using a digital watch.\n\nFormat This data frame contains the following columns:\n\nInterval: Waiting time between eruptions (seconds)\n\nSource Kiama Blowhole Eruptions.

Do the data come from a population that is normally distributed?\n\nConsidering the density plot is skewed right, and the normal probability plot does not look linear, then the conclusion is that this sample is not from a population that is normally distributed.\n\n### Example: Is It Normal?\n\nThe US National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) conducted a series of health and nutrition surveys called NHANES.

You measure how accurate using probability. In both binomial and normal distributions, you needed to know that the random variable followed either distribution. You need to know how the statistic is distributed and then you can find probabilities. In other words, you need to know the shape of the sample mean or whatever statistic you want to make a decision about.\n\nHow is the statistic distributed? This is answered with a sampling distribution.\n\n**Sampling Distribution**: how a sample statistic is distributed when repeated trials of size $n$ are taken.\n\n### Example: Sampling Distribution\n\nThe NHANES data frame has the pulse rates for approximately 50,000 individuals. The random variable is $x$ = pulse rate. The probability distribution of this random variable is presented in @fig-NHANES6h-density. Although pulse rates from 50,000 individuals isn't the entire population, the sample is most likely a good representation of the population. Thus, it is safe to assume the population is normally distributed. An estimate for the population mean is 73.6 pbm, and the population standard deviation estimate is 12.2 bpm.\n\n```{r NHANES6h-density}\n#| fig-alt: \"Density plot of pulse rate. Appears to be normally distributed.\"\n#| warning: FALSE\n#| label: fig-NHANES6h-density\n#| fig-cap: \"Distribution of Pulse Rate\"\ngf_density(~Pulse, data=NHANES, title = \"Pulse Rate\", xlab=\"Pulse (bpm)\") \ndf_stats(~Pulse, data=NHANES, mean, sd)\n```\n\nSuppose you take a random sample of 10 pulse rates from those 50,000 individuals. A random sample of data from 10 individuals is:\n\n```{r NHANES6-sample10}\nNHANES|> \n  sample_n(size=10) \n```\n\nIt might be useful to find the mean pulse rate from a random sample of size 10.\n\n```{r NHANES6-stats, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}\nNHANES|>\n  sample_n(size=10)|>\n  df_stats(~Pulse, mean)\n```\n\nNow suppose you took another random sample of size 10 and found the mean pulse rate for that sample. Repeat this process 100 times. At this point you would basically have a new sample of 100 mean pulse rates. You could assess how this sample is distributed by creating a density plot @fig-NHANES6e-density\n\n```{r NHANES6e-density}\n#| fig-alt: \"Density plot of sample means when sample size is 10. Appears to be bell shaped.\"\n#| warning: FALSE\n#| label: fig-NHANES6e-density\n#| fig-cap: \"Density Plot of Sample Means When n = 10\"\nTrials <- do(100) * { NHANES |> \n    sample_n(size = 10) |>\n    df_stats( ~Pulse, means = mean)}\ngf_density( ~means, data = Trials, title = \"Density plot of sample mean when n=10\")\n\ndf_stats(~means, data=Trials, mean, sd)\n```\n\nThis distribution is a sampling distribution. That is all a sampling distribution is. It is a distribution created from statistics.\n\nNotice the distribution does look a great deal like the distribution of the original random variable. Notice the mean of the sample means $\\mu_{\\bar{x}} = 73.8$ bpm which is almost the same of as the mean of the population. The standard deviation of the sample means, $\\sigma_{\\bar{x}}=4.35$ pbm is about $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the population standard deviation.\n\nWhat does this distribution look like if instead of repeating the experiment 10 times you repeat it 50 times instead?\n\nThis density plot of the sampling distribution is displayed in @fig-NHANES6f-density\n\n```{r NHANES6f-density}\n#| fig-alt: \"Density plot of sample means when sample size is 50. Appears to be bell shaped.\"\n#| warning: FALSE\n#| label: fig-NHANES6f-density\n#| fig-cap: \"Density Plot of Sample Means When n = 50\"\nTrials <- do(100) * { NHANES |>\n    sample_n(size = 50) |>\n    df_stats( ~Pulse, means = mean) }\ngf_density( ~means, data = Trials, title=\"Sample means when n=50\")|>\n  gf_lims(x=c(68,79))\ndf_stats(~means, data=Trials, mean, sd) \n```\n\nNotice this density plot of the sample mean looks approximately symmetrical and could almost be called normal. Notice, the mean of the sample means is 73.6 bpm which is approximately what the population mean is. The standard deviation of the sample means is 1.77 bpm which is around $\\frac{1}{7}$ of the population standard deviation. What if you keep increasing $n$? What will the sampling distribution of the sample mean look like? In other words, what does the sampling distribution of $\\bar{x}$ look like as $n$ gets even larger?\n\nThis depends on how the original distribution is distributed. In [Example: Sampling Distribution], the random variable was approximately normally distributed. When $n$ was 10, the distribution of the mean looked approximately normal. What if the original distribution wasn't normal? How big would $n$ have to be? Consider a different variable in the NHANES data frame that isn't normally distributed such as age when a participant started to smoke cigarettes (SmokeAge). The density plot for the large sample is in @fig-NHANES6g-density. The mean for the large sample is 17.8 years and the standard deviation is 5.3 years, so $\\mu=17.8$ dollars and $\\sigma=5.3$ dollars approximately.\n\n```{r NHANES6g-density}\n#| fig-alt: \"Density plot of age when person started smoking. Appears to not be bell shaped.\"\n#| warning: FALSE\n#| label: fig-NHANES6g-density\n#| fig-cap: \"Density Plot of Age When Person Started Smoking.\"\ngf_density(~SmokeAge, data=NHANES, title = \"Density Plot of Age when Person Started Smoking\", xlab=\"Age\") \ndf_stats(~SmokeAge, data=NHANES, mean, sd) \n```\n\nNow take 100 samples of size 50 individuals from the NHANES Data Frame. Then graph a density plot of SmokeAge, the age when someone started to smoke. Notice the the sampling distribution of the sample means looks fairly normally distributed even though the original random variable was not normally distributed. The mean of the sample mean. $\\mu_{ \\bar{x}}=$ 17.8 years and the standard deviation of the sample mean, $\\sigma_{\\bar{x}}=$ 1.56 years. The mean of the sample mean is the same as the mean of the population, but the standard deviation of the sample mean is much less than the standard deviation of the original data.\n\n```{r NHANES6-random}\n#| fig-alt: \"Density plot of mean age a person starts to smoke of a sample of size 50. Appears to be bell shaped.\"\n#| warning: FALSE\n#| echo: FALSE\n#| label: fig-NHANES6-random-density\n#| fig-cap: \"Density Plot of Age When Person Started Smoking when sample size is 50.\"\nTrials <- do(100) * { NHANES |>\n    sample_n(size = 50) |>\n    df_stats( ~SmokeAge, means = mean) }\ngf_density( ~means, data = Trials, title = \"Density plot of sample means age a person starts smoking with sample size 50.\")%>% gf_lims(x=c(13,24))\ndf_stats(~means, data=Trials, mean, sd) \n```\n\nOne question is, why is the mean of the sample means the same as the mean of the population? Suppose you have a random variable that has a population mean, $\\mu$, and a population standard deviation, $\\sigma$. If a sample of size $n$ is taken, then the sample mean, has a mean $\\mu_{ \\bar{x}}=\\mu$ and standard deviation of $\\sigma_{ \\bar{x}}=\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}$ . The standard deviation of the sample mean is lower because by taking the mean you are averaging out the extreme values, which makes the distribution of the sample mean less spread out.\n\nYou now know the center and the variability of $\\bar{x}$. You also want to know the shape of the distribution of $\\bar{x}$. You hope it is normal, since you know how to find probabilities using the normal curve. The following theorem tells you the requirement to have $\\bar{x}$ be normally distributed.\n\n### **Central Limit Theorem**\n\nSuppose a random variable is from any distribution. If a sample of size $n$ is taken, the the sample mean, $\\bar{x}$, becomes normally distributed as $n$ increases.\n\nWhat this says is that no matter what $x$ looks like, $\\bar{x}$ would look normal if $n$ is large enough. Now, what size of $n$ is large enough? That depends on how $x$ is distributed in the first place. If the original random variable is normally distributed, then $n$ just needs to be 2 or more data points. If the original random variable is somewhat mound shaped and symmetrical, then $n$ needs to be greater than or equal to 30. Sometimes the sample size can be smaller, but this is a good general rule to use. The sample size may have to be much larger if the original random variable is really skewed one way or another.\n\nNow that you know when the sample mean will look like a normal distribution, then you can find the probability related to the sample mean. Remember that the mean of the sample mean is just the mean of the original data ($\\mu_{\\bar{x}}=\\mu$), but the standard deviation of the sample mean, $\\sigma_{\\bar{x}}$, also known as the standard error of the mean, is actually $\\sigma_{\\bar{x}}=\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}$. Make sure you use this in all calculations. If you are using the $z$-score, the formula when working with $\\bar{x}$ is $z=\\frac{x-\\mu_{\\bar{x}}}{\\sigma_{\\bar{x}}}=\\frac{x-\\mu}{\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}}$. To use rStudio to calculate probabilities use $P(\\bar{x}<a)= pnorm(a, \\mu_{\\bar{x}}, \\sigma_{\\bar{x}}, lower.tail=TRUE)$ $P(\\bar{x}>a)= pnorm(a, \\mu_{\\bar{x}}, \\sigma_{\\bar{x}}, lower.tail=FALSE)$.\n\n### Example: Finding Probabilities for Sample Means\n\nThe birth weight of boy babies of European descent who were delivered at 40 weeks is normally distributed with a mean of 3687.6 g with a standard deviation of 410.5 g (Janssen, Thiessen, Klein, Whitfield, MacNab & Cullis-Kuhl, 2007). Suppose there were nine European descent boy babies born on a given day and the mean birth weight is calculated.\n\na.  State the random variable.\nb.  What is the mean of the sample mean?\nc.  What is the standard deviation of the sample mean?\nd.  What distribution is the sample mean distributed as?\ne.  Find the probability that the mean weight of the nine boy babies born was less than 3500.4 g.\nf.  Find the probability that the mean weight of the nine babies born was less than 3452.5 g.\n\n#### **Solution**\n\na.  State the random variable.\n\n$x$ = birth weight of boy babies (Note: the random variable is something you measure, and it is not the mean birth weight. Mean weight is calculated.)\n\nb.  What is the mean of the sample mean?\n\n$\\mu_{\\bar{x}}=\\mu=3687.4g$\n\nc.  What is the standard deviation of the sample mean?\n\n$\\sigma_{\\bar{x}}=\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}=\\frac{410.5g}{\\sqrt{9}}=136.8g$\n\nd.  What distribution is the sample mean distributed as?\n\nSince the original random variable is distributed normally, then the sample mean is distributed normally.\n\ne.  Find the probability that the mean weight of the nine boy babies born was less than 3500.4 g.\n\nTo find $P(\\bar{x}<3500.4)=0.086$. use the rStudio command\n\n```{r pnorm6a}\npnorm(3500.4,3687.6, 410.5/sqrt(9), lower.tail = TRUE)\n```\n\nThere is an 8.6% chance that the mean birth weight of the nine boy babies born would be less than 3500.4 g. Since this is more than 5%, this is not unusual.\n\nf.  Find the probability that the mean weight of the nine babies born was less than 3452.5 g.\n\nYou are looking for the $P(\\bar{x}<3452.5)$.\n\nTo find in rStudio, $P(\\bar{x}<3452.5)=0.043$ use the command\n\n```{r pnorm6b}\npnorm(3452.5, 3687.4, 410.5/sqrt(9), lower.tail = TRUE)\n```\n\nThere is a 4.3% chance that the mean birth weight of the nine boy babies born would be less than 3452.5 g. Since this is less than 5% this would be an unusual event. If it actually happened, then you may think there is something unusual about this sample. Maybe some of the nine babies were born as multiples, which brings the mean weight down, or some or all of the babies were not of European descent (in fact the mean weight of South Asian boy babies is 3452.5 g), or some were born before 40 weeks, or the babies were born at high altitudes.\n\n### Example: Finding Probabilities for Sample Means\n\nFor Americans that smoke, the average age that they started smoking is 17.8 years, with a standard deviation of approximately 1.56 years from the NHANES data. This random variable is not normally distributed, though it is somewhat mound shaped.\n\na.  State the random variable.\nb.  Suppose a sample of 35 smoking American's is taken. Find the probability that the mean age that these 35 smoking Americans started to smoke is more than 21 years.\n\n#### **Solution**\n\na.  State the random variable.\n\n$x$ = age that smoking Americans started to smoke\n\nb.  Suppose a sample of 35 smoking American's is taken. Find the probability that the mean age that these 35 smoking Americans started to smoke is more than 21 years.\n\nEven though the original random variable is not normally distributed, the sample size is over 30, by the central limit theorem the sample mean will be normally distributed. The mean of the sample mean is $\\mu_{\\bar{x}}=17.8$. The standard deviation of the sample mean is $\\sigma_{\\bar{x}}=\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}=\\frac{1.56}{\\sqrt{35}}$. You have all the information you need to use the normal command using rStudio. Without the central limit theorem, you couldn't use the normal command, and you would not be able to answer this question.\n\nThe probability that the mean age that 35 smoking Americans start to smoke is more than 21 years, is the mathematical statement $P(\\bar{x}>21)$\n\nTo find $P(\\bar{x}>21)= 3.42X10^{-34}$ using r studio, use the command:\n\n```{r pnorm6c}\npnorm(21, 17.8, 1.56/sqrt(35), lower.tail=FALSE) \n```\n\nThe probability of a sample mean of 35 smoking Americans being more than 21 years when they smoked for the first time is very small. This is extremely unlikely to happen. If it does, it may make you wonder about the sample. Could the population mean have increased from the 17.8 years as was stated? Could the sample not have been random, and instead have been a group of smoking Americans who had started to smoke much later? These questions, and more, are ones that you would want to ask as a researcher\n\n### Homework for Sampling Distribution and the Central Limit Theorem Section\n\n1.

Mostly that chapter focused on the binomial experiment. There are many other experiments from discrete random variables that exist but are not covered in this book.\n\nChapter 6 deals with probability distributions that arise from continuous random variables. The focus of this chapter is a distribution known as the normal distribution, though realize that there are many other distributions that exist. A few others are examined in future chapters.\n\nLooking at the density plot of a quantitative variable, one can guess what the distribution of that variable is. As an example, consider the NHANES data frame. One variable to consider is Weight. The density plot of Weight is\n\n```{r NHANES6-density}\n#| fig-alt: \"Density plot of a person's weight.

The density plot for this variable is @fig-HeadCirc-density\n\n```{r headcirc6-density}\n#| fig-alt: \"Density plot of head circumference of a person.

The density plot is\n\n```{r NHANES6a-density}\n#| fig-alt: \"Density plot of BMI of a person that is skewed right.\"\n#| warning: FALSE\n#| echo: FALSE\n#| label: fig-BMI-density\n#| fig-cap: \"Density Plot of BMI of a Person\"\ngf_density(~BMI, data=NHANES, title = \"BMI of a Person\", xlab=\"Body Mass Index\")\n```\n\nThis density plot @fig-BMI-density appears to be skewed right\n\nNow consider the variable SmokeAge. Its density plot is @fig-Smoking-density\n\n```{r NHANES6b-density}\n#| fig-alt: \"Density plot of age when a person started smoking. Appears to be bimodal.\"\n#| warning: FALSE\n#| echo: FALSE\n#| label: fig-Smoking-density\n#| fig-cap: \"Density Plot of Age when Person Started Smoking\"\ngf_density(~SmokeAge, data=NHANES, title=\"Age when a Person Started Smoking\", xlab=\"Age\")\n```\n\nThis distribution appears to be bimodal.\n\nlastly, consider the variable Pulse. The density plot is @fig-Pulse-density\n\n```{r NHANES6c-density}\n#| fig-alt: \"Density plot of pulse rate of a person. Appears to be symmetric.\"\n#| warning: FALSE\n#| echo: FALSE\n#| label: fig-Pulse-density\n#| fig-cap: \"Density Plot of Pulse Rate of a person\"\ngf_density(~Pulse, data=NHANES, title = \"Pulse Rate of a Person\", xlab=\"Pulse\")\n```\n\nThis density plot appears to be symmetric and could almost be considered bell shaped.\n\nThe reason that one considers the density plots to understand the distribution of the population, is that in some cases the distribution can be approximated with a known distribution that has certain properties. There are many known distribution. Some examples are the Uniform distribution, the Chi-Squared distribution, the Student's T distribution, and the normal distribution. The normal distribution is one of the more common distributions to use as a model, and it will be explored in this chapter. But do realize that there are many other distributions that one can use.\n\n## Normal Distribution\n\nMany populations have a distribution that is a symmetric, unimodal, and bell-shaped. For example: height, blood pressure, and cholesterol level. However, not every bell shaped curve is a normal curve. In a normal curve, there is a specific relationship between its \"height\" and its \"width.\" Normal curves can be tall and skinny or they can be short and fat. They are all symmetric, unimodal, and centered at $\\mu$, the population mean.\n\n@fig-normal-curvea and @fig-normal-curveb show two different normal curves drawn on the same scale. Both have $\\mu=2$ but the one in @fig-normal-curvea has a standard deviation of 1 and the one in @fig-normal-curveb has a standard deviation of 4. Notice that the larger standard deviation makes the graph wider (more spread out) and shorter.\n\n```{r normal-curvea}\n#| fig-alt: \"Bell curve with mean 2 and standard deviation of 1\"\n#| warning: FALSE\n#| echo: FALSE\n#| label: fig-normal-curvea\n#| fig-cap: \"Normal curve with mean 2 and standard deviation 1\"\ncord.x <- c(-2, seq(-2, 7, .1),-1) \ncord.y <- c(0,dnorm(seq(-2, 7, .1), 2, 1),0) \ncurve(dnorm(x, 2, 1),xlim=c(2-3*4,2+3*4)) \npolygon(cord.x,cord.y)\n```\n\n```{r normal-curveb}\n#| fig-alt: \"Bell curve with mean 2 and standard deviation of 4\"\n#| warning: FALSE\n#| echo: FALSE\n#| label: fig-normal-curveb\n#| fig-cap: \"Normal curve with mean 2 and standard deviation 4\"\ncord.x <- c(-10, seq(-10, 15, .1),-1) \ncord.y <- c(0,dnorm(seq(-10, 15, .1), 2, 4),0) \ncurve(dnorm(x, 2, 4),xlim=c(2-3*4,2+3*4), ylim=c(0,0.4)) \npolygon(cord.x,cord.y) \n```\n\nEvery normal curve has common features.\n\n-   The center, or the highest point, is at the population mean, $\\mu$.\n-   The transition points are the places where the curve changes from a \"hill\" to a \"valley\". The distance from the mean to the transition point is one standard deviation.\n-   The area under the whole curve is exactly 1. Therefore, the area under the half below or above the mean is 0.5.\n\nJust as in a discrete probability distribution, the object is to find the probability of an event occurring. However, unlike in a discrete probability distribution where the event can be a single value, in a continuous probability distribution the event must be a range. You are interested in finding the probability of $x$ occurring in the range between $a$ and $b$, or $P(a \\le x \\le b) = P(a<x<b)$. Calculus tells us this probability is the area under the curve in the interval from $a$ to $b$.\n\nBefore looking at the process for finding the probabilities under the normal curve, it is somewhat useful to look at the **Empirical Rule** that gives approximate values for these areas. The Empirical Rule is just an approximation and it will only be used in this section to give you an idea of what the size of the probabilities is for different shadings. A more precise method for finding probabilities for the normal curve will be demonstrated in the next section. Please do not use the empirical rule except for real rough estimates.\n\n**The Empirical Rule** for any normal distribution: Approximately 68% of the data is within one standard deviation of the mean. Approximately 95% of the data is within two standard deviations of the mean. Approximately 99.7% of the data is within three standard deviations of the mean.\n\n![Empirical Rule Graph](Empirical_rule.png){fig-alt=\"Empirical Rule graph with 68% of data between -1 and 1 standard deviation of mean, 95% between -2 and 2, and 99.7% between -3 and 3\"}\n\nBe careful, there is still some area left over in each end. Remember, the maximum a probability can be is 100%, so if you calculate you will see that for both ends together there is 0.3% of the curve. Because of symmetry, you can divide this equally between both ends and find that there is 0.15% in each tail beyond the 3rd standard deviations.\n\n## Finding Probabilities for the Normal Distribution\n\nThe Empirical Rule is just an approximation and only works for certain values. What if you want to find the probability for $x$ values that are not integer multiples of the standard deviation? The probability is the area under the curve. To find areas under the curve, you need calculus. Before technology, you needed to convert every $x$ value to a standardized number, called the $z$-score or $z$-value or simply just $z$. The $z$-score is a measure of how many standard deviations an $x$ value is from the mean. To convert from a normally distributed $x$ value to a $z$-score, you use the following formula.\n\n$z-score=\\frac{x-\\mu}{\\sigma}$\n\nwhere $\\mu$ = mean of the population of the $x$ value and $\\sigma$ = standard deviation for the population of the $x$ value\n\nThe $z$-score is normally distributed, with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. It is known as the standard normal curve. The $z$-score is a measure of how many standard deviations a data value is from its mean. If the $z$ - score is positive, the data value is above the mean. If the $z$-score is negative, the data value is below the mean. The farther the $z$-value is from 0, the farther the data value is from the mean.\n\nThese days technology can find probabilities without converting to the $z$-score and looking the probabilities up in a table. There are many programs available that will calculate the probability for a normal curve. The command on r to find the area to the left $P(x<value)$ is\n\npnorm(value, mean, standard_deviation, lower.tail=TRUE)\n\nThe command on r to find the area to the right, $P(x>value)$ is\n\npnorm(value, mean, standard_deviation, lower.tail=FALSE)\n\n### Example: General Normal Distribution\n\nThe length of a human pregnancy is normally distributed with a mean of 272 days with a standard deviation of 9 days (Bhat & Kushtagi, 2006).\n\na.

Find the length of pregnancy that 10% of all pregnancies last less than.\n\nThis problem is asking you to find an $x$ value from a probability. You want to find the $x$ value that has 10% of the length of pregnancies to the left of it. In this case, you are given the probability. In r, the command is\n\nqnorm(area, mean, standard_deviation, lower.tail=TRUE or FALSE)\n\nFor this example since you know the area in the lower tail, then use lower.tail=TRUE. So the command is\n\n```{r qnorm6}\nqnorm(0.1, 272, 9, lower.tail = TRUE)\n```\n\nThus 10% of all pregnancies last less than approximately 260 days.\n\nf.

Would this be unusual and what might you think?\n\nFrom part (c) you found the probability that a pregnancy lasts less than 250 days is 0.73%. Since this is less than 5%, it is very unusual. You would think that either the woman had a premature baby, or that she may be wrong about when she actually became pregnant.\n\n### Example: General Normal Distribution\n\nThe mean mathematics SAT score in 2012 was 514 with a standard deviation of 117 (\"Total group profile,\" 2012).

One way is to take a sample and look at the sample to determine if it appears normal. If the sample looks normal, then most likely the population is also. Here are some guidelines that are use to help make that determination.\n\n1.  **Density Plot**: Make a density plot. For a normal distribution, the density plot should be roughly bell-shaped. For small samples, this is not very accurate, and another method is needed. A distribution may not look normally distributed from the density plot, but it still may be normally distributed.\n\n2.  **Normal quantile plot (or normal probability plot)**: This plot is provided through statistical software on a computer. If the points lie close to a line, the data comes from a distribution that is approximately normally distributed. If the points do not lie close to a line or they show a pattern that is not a line, the data are likely to come from a distribution that is not normally distributed.\n\n### **To create a density plot on rStudio:**\n\nRead the Data Frame into r Studio. The command for density is\n\ngf_density(\\~variable, data=Data_Frame)\n\nSee chapter 2 for more examples of this.\n\n### **To create a normal quantile plot on rStudio**\n\nRead the Data Frame into rStudio. The command for normal quantile plot is\n\ngf_qqnorm(\\~variable, data=Data_Frame)\n\nRealize that your random variable may be normally distributed, even if the sample fails the two tests. However, if the density plot definitely doesn't look symmetric and bell shaped, and the normal probability plot doesn't look linear, then you can be fairly confident that the data set does not come from a population that is normally distributed.\n\n### Example: Is It Normal?\n\nIn Kiama, NSW, Australia, there is a blowhole. The data in @tbl-Eruption are times in seconds between eruptions (\"Kiama blowhole eruptions,\" 2013). Do the data come from a population that is normally distributed?\n\n```{r eruption6-data}\n#| tbl-alt: \"Time (in Seconds) Between Kiama Blowhole Eruptions\"\n#| label: tbl-Eruption\n#| tbl-cap: \"Time (in Seconds) Between Kiama Blowhole Eruptions\"\nEruption<-read.csv( \"https://krkozak.github.io/MAT160/Blowhole_eruptions.csv\") \nknitr::kable(head(Eruption))\n```\n\n**Code book for Data Frame Eruption**\n\n**Description** The ocean swell produces spectacular eruptions of water through a hole in the cliff at Kiama, about 120km south of Sydney, known as the Blowhole. The times at which 65 successive eruptions occurred from 1340 hours on 12 July 1998 were observed using a digital watch.\n\nFormat This data frame contains the following columns:\n\nInterval: Waiting time between eruptions (seconds)\n\nSource Kiama Blowhole Eruptions.

Do the data come from a population that is normally distributed?\n\nConsidering the density plot is skewed right, and the normal probability plot does not look linear, then the conclusion is that this sample is not from a population that is normally distributed.\n\n### Example: Is It Normal?\n\nThe US National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) conducted a series of health and nutrition surveys called NHANES.

You measure how accurate using probability. In both binomial and normal distributions, you needed to know that the random variable followed either distribution. You need to know how the statistic is distributed and then you can find probabilities. In other words, you need to know the shape of the sample mean or whatever statistic you want to make a decision about.\n\nHow is the statistic distributed? This is answered with a sampling distribution.\n\n**Sampling Distribution**: how a sample statistic is distributed when repeated trials of size $n$ are taken.\n\n### Example: Sampling Distribution\n\nThe NHANES data frame has the pulse rates for approximately 50,000 individuals. The random variable is $x$ = pulse rate. The probability distribution of this random variable is presented in @fig-NHANES6h-density. Although pulse rates from 50,000 individuals isn't the entire population, the sample is most likely a good representation of the population. Thus, it is safe to assume the population is normally distributed. An estimate for the population mean is 73.6 pbm, and the population standard deviation estimate is 12.2 bpm.\n\n```{r NHANES6h-density}\n#| fig-alt: \"Density plot of pulse rate. Appears to be normally distributed.\"\n#| warning: FALSE\n#| label: fig-NHANES6h-density\n#| fig-cap: \"Distribution of Pulse Rate\"\ngf_density(~Pulse, data=NHANES, title = \"Pulse Rate\", xlab=\"Pulse (bpm)\") \ndf_stats(~Pulse, data=NHANES, mean, sd)\n```\n\nSuppose you take a random sample of 10 pulse rates from those 50,000 individuals. A random sample of data from 10 individuals is:\n\n```{r NHANES6-sample10}\nNHANES|> \n  sample_n(size=10) \n```\n\nIt might be useful to find the mean pulse rate from a random sample of size 10.\n\n```{r NHANES6-stats, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}\nNHANES|>\n  sample_n(size=10)|>\n  df_stats(~Pulse, mean)\n```\n\nNow suppose you took another random sample of size 10 and found the mean pulse rate for that sample. Repeat this process 100 times. At this point you would basically have a new sample of 100 mean pulse rates. You could assess how this sample is distributed by creating a density plot @fig-NHANES6e-density\n\n```{r NHANES6e-density}\n#| fig-alt: \"Density plot of sample means when sample size is 10. Appears to be bell shaped.\"\n#| warning: FALSE\n#| label: fig-NHANES6e-density\n#| fig-cap: \"Density Plot of Sample Means When n = 10\"\nTrials <- do(100) * { NHANES |> \n    sample_n(size = 10) |>\n    df_stats( ~Pulse, means = mean)}\ngf_density( ~means, data = Trials, title = \"Density plot of sample mean when n=10\")\n\ndf_stats(~means, data=Trials, mean, sd)\n```\n\nThis distribution is a sampling distribution. That is all a sampling distribution is. It is a distribution created from statistics.\n\nNotice the distribution does look a great deal like the distribution of the original random variable. Notice the mean of the sample means $\\mu_{\\bar{x}} = 73.8$ bpm which is almost the same of as the mean of the population. The standard deviation of the sample means, $\\sigma_{\\bar{x}}=4.35$ pbm is about $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the population standard deviation.\n\nWhat does this distribution look like if instead of repeating the experiment 10 times you repeat it 50 times instead?\n\nThis density plot of the sampling distribution is displayed in @fig-NHANES6f-density\n\n```{r NHANES6f-density}\n#| fig-alt: \"Density plot of sample means when sample size is 50. Appears to be bell shaped.\"\n#| warning: FALSE\n#| label: fig-NHANES6f-density\n#| fig-cap: \"Density Plot of Sample Means When n = 50\"\nTrials <- do(100) * { NHANES |>\n    sample_n(size = 50) |>\n    df_stats( ~Pulse, means = mean) }\ngf_density( ~means, data = Trials, title=\"Sample means when n=50\")|>\n  gf_lims(x=c(68,79))\ndf_stats(~means, data=Trials, mean, sd) \n```\n\nNotice this density plot of the sample mean looks approximately symmetrical and could almost be called normal. Notice, the mean of the sample means is 73.6 bpm which is approximately what the population mean is. The standard deviation of the sample means is 1.77 bpm which is around $\\frac{1}{7}$ of the population standard deviation. What if you keep increasing $n$? What will the sampling distribution of the sample mean look like? In other words, what does the sampling distribution of $\\bar{x}$ look like as $n$ gets even larger?\n\nThis depends on how the original distribution is distributed. In [Example: Sampling Distribution], the random variable was approximately normally distributed. When $n$ was 10, the distribution of the mean looked approximately normal. What if the original distribution wasn't normal? How big would $n$ have to be? Consider a different variable in the NHANES data frame that isn't normally distributed such as age when a participant started to smoke cigarettes (SmokeAge). The density plot for the large sample is in @fig-NHANES6g-density. The mean for the large sample is 17.8 years and the standard deviation is 5.3 years, so $\\mu=17.8$ dollars and $\\sigma=5.3$ dollars approximately.\n\n```{r NHANES6g-density}\n#| fig-alt: \"Density plot of age when person started smoking. Appears to not be bell shaped.\"\n#| warning: FALSE\n#| label: fig-NHANES6g-density\n#| fig-cap: \"Density Plot of Age When Person Started Smoking.\"\ngf_density(~SmokeAge, data=NHANES, title = \"Density Plot of Age when Person Started Smoking\", xlab=\"Age\") \ndf_stats(~SmokeAge, data=NHANES, mean, sd) \n```\n\nNow take 100 samples of size 50 individuals from the NHANES Data Frame. Then graph a density plot of SmokeAge, the age when someone started to smoke. Notice the the sampling distribution of the sample means looks fairly normally distributed even though the original random variable was not normally distributed. The mean of the sample mean. $\\mu_{ \\bar{x}}=$ 17.8 years and the standard deviation of the sample mean, $\\sigma_{\\bar{x}}=$ 1.56 years. The mean of the sample mean is the same as the mean of the population, but the standard deviation of the sample mean is much less than the standard deviation of the original data.\n\n```{r NHANES6-random}\n#| fig-alt: \"Density plot of mean age a person starts to smoke of a sample of size 50. Appears to be bell shaped.\"\n#| warning: FALSE\n#| echo: FALSE\n#| label: fig-NHANES6-random-density\n#| fig-cap: \"Density Plot of Age When Person Started Smoking when sample size is 50.\"\nTrials <- do(100) * { NHANES |>\n    sample_n(size = 50) |>\n    df_stats( ~SmokeAge, means = mean) }\ngf_density( ~means, data = Trials, title = \"Density plot of sample means age a person starts smoking with sample size 50.\")%>% gf_lims(x=c(13,24))\ndf_stats(~means, data=Trials, mean, sd) \n```\n\nOne question is, why is the mean of the sample means the same as the mean of the population? Suppose you have a random variable that has a population mean, $\\mu$, and a population standard deviation, $\\sigma$. If a sample of size $n$ is taken, then the sample mean, has a mean $\\mu_{ \\bar{x}}=\\mu$ and standard deviation of $\\sigma_{ \\bar{x}}=\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}$ . The standard deviation of the sample mean is lower because by taking the mean you are averaging out the extreme values, which makes the distribution of the sample mean less spread out.\n\nYou now know the center and the variability of $\\bar{x}$. You also want to know the shape of the distribution of $\\bar{x}$. You hope it is normal, since you know how to find probabilities using the normal curve. The following theorem tells you the requirement to have $\\bar{x}$ be normally distributed.\n\n### **Central Limit Theorem**\n\nSuppose a random variable is from any distribution. If a sample of size $n$ is taken, the the sample mean, $\\bar{x}$, becomes normally distributed as $n$ increases.\n\nWhat this says is that no matter what $x$ looks like, $\\bar{x}$ would look normal if $n$ is large enough. Now, what size of $n$ is large enough? That depends on how $x$ is distributed in the first place. If the original random variable is normally distributed, then $n$ just needs to be 2 or more data points. If the original random variable is somewhat mound shaped and symmetrical, then $n$ needs to be greater than or equal to 30. Sometimes the sample size can be smaller, but this is a good general rule to use. The sample size may have to be much larger if the original random variable is really skewed one way or another.\n\nNow that you know when the sample mean will look like a normal distribution, then you can find the probability related to the sample mean. Remember that the mean of the sample mean is just the mean of the original data ($\\mu_{\\bar{x}}=\\mu$), but the standard deviation of the sample mean, $\\sigma_{\\bar{x}}$, also known as the standard error of the mean, is actually $\\sigma_{\\bar{x}}=\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}$. Make sure you use this in all calculations. If you are using the $z$-score, the formula when working with $\\bar{x}$ is $z=\\frac{x-\\mu_{\\bar{x}}}{\\sigma_{\\bar{x}}}=\\frac{x-\\mu}{\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}}$. To use rStudio to calculate probabilities use $P(\\bar{x}<a)= pnorm(a, \\mu_{\\bar{x}}, \\sigma_{\\bar{x}}, lower.tail=TRUE)$ $P(\\bar{x}>a)= pnorm(a, \\mu_{\\bar{x}}, \\sigma_{\\bar{x}}, lower.tail=FALSE)$.\n\n### Example: Finding Probabilities for Sample Means\n\nThe birth weight of boy babies of European descent who were delivered at 40 weeks is normally distributed with a mean of 3687.6 g with a standard deviation of 410.5 g (Janssen, Thiessen, Klein, Whitfield, MacNab & Cullis-Kuhl, 2007). Suppose there were nine European descent boy babies born on a given day and the mean birth weight is calculated.\n\na.  State the random variable.\nb.  What is the mean of the sample mean?\nc.  What is the standard deviation of the sample mean?\nd.  What distribution is the sample mean distributed as?\ne.  Find the probability that the mean weight of the nine boy babies born was less than 3500.4 g.\nf.  Find the probability that the mean weight of the nine babies born was less than 3452.5 g.\n\n#### **Solution**\n\na.  State the random variable.\n\n$x$ = birth weight of boy babies (Note: the random variable is something you measure, and it is not the mean birth weight. Mean weight is calculated.)\n\nb.  What is the mean of the sample mean?\n\n$\\mu_{\\bar{x}}=\\mu=3687.4g$\n\nc.  What is the standard deviation of the sample mean?\n\n$\\sigma_{\\bar{x}}=\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}=\\frac{410.5g}{\\sqrt{9}}=136.8g$\n\nd.  What distribution is the sample mean distributed as?\n\nSince the original random variable is distributed normally, then the sample mean is distributed normally.\n\ne.  Find the probability that the mean weight of the nine boy babies born was less than 3500.4 g.\n\nTo find $P(\\bar{x}<3500.4)=0.086$. use the rStudio command\n\n```{r pnorm6a}\npnorm(3500.4,3687.6, 410.5/sqrt(9), lower.tail = TRUE)\n```\n\nThere is an 8.6% chance that the mean birth weight of the nine boy babies born would be less than 3500.4 g. Since this is more than 5%, this is not unusual.\n\nf.  Find the probability that the mean weight of the nine babies born was less than 3452.5 g.\n\nYou are looking for the $P(\\bar{x}<3452.5)$.\n\nTo find in rStudio, $P(\\bar{x}<3452.5)=0.043$ use the command\n\n```{r pnorm6b}\npnorm(3452.5, 3687.4, 410.5/sqrt(9), lower.tail = TRUE)\n```\n\nThere is a 4.3% chance that the mean birth weight of the nine boy babies born would be less than 3452.5 g. Since this is less than 5% this would be an unusual event. If it actually happened, then you may think there is something unusual about this sample. Maybe some of the nine babies were born as multiples, which brings the mean weight down, or some or all of the babies were not of European descent (in fact the mean weight of South Asian boy babies is 3452.5 g), or some were born before 40 weeks, or the babies were born at high altitudes.\n\n### Example: Finding Probabilities for Sample Means\n\nFor Americans that smoke, the average age that they started smoking is 17.8 years, with a standard deviation of approximately 1.56 years from the NHANES data. This random variable is not normally distributed, though it is somewhat mound shaped.\n\na.  State the random variable.\nb.  Suppose a sample of 35 smoking American's is taken. Find the probability that the mean age that these 35 smoking Americans started to smoke is more than 21 years.\n\n#### **Solution**\n\na.  State the random variable.\n\n$x$ = age that smoking Americans started to smoke\n\nb.  Suppose a sample of 35 smoking American's is taken. Find the probability that the mean age that these 35 smoking Americans started to smoke is more than 21 years.\n\nEven though the original random variable is not normally distributed, the sample size is over 30, by the central limit theorem the sample mean will be normally distributed. The mean of the sample mean is $\\mu_{\\bar{x}}=17.8$. The standard deviation of the sample mean is $\\sigma_{\\bar{x}}=\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}=\\frac{1.56}{\\sqrt{35}}$. You have all the information you need to use the normal command using rStudio. Without the central limit theorem, you couldn't use the normal command, and you would not be able to answer this question.\n\nThe probability that the mean age that 35 smoking Americans start to smoke is more than 21 years, is the mathematical statement $P(\\bar{x}>21)$\n\nTo find $P(\\bar{x}>21)= 3.42X10^{-34}$ using r studio, use the command:\n\n```{r pnorm6c}\npnorm(21, 17.8, 1.56/sqrt(35), lower.tail=FALSE) \n```\n\nThe probability of a sample mean of 35 smoking Americans being more than 21 years when they smoked for the first time is very small. This is extremely unlikely to happen. If it does, it may make you wonder about the sample. Could the population mean have increased from the 17.8 years as was stated? Could the sample not have been random, and instead have been a group of smoking Americans who had started to smoke much later? These questions, and more, are ones that you would want to ask as a researcher\n\n### Homework for Sampling Distribution and the Central Limit Theorem Section\n\n1.
