Remember, in most cases you can't collect the entire population, so you have to take a sample. Thus, you collect data either through a sample or a census. Now you have a large number of data values. What can you do with them? No one likes to look at just a set of numbers. One thing is to organize the data into a table or graph. Ultimately though, you want to be able to use that graph to interpret the data, to describe the distribution of the data set, and to explore different characteristics of the data. The characteristics that will be discussed in this chapter and the next chapter are:\n\n1.  Center: middle of the data set, also known as the average.\n2.  Variation: how much the data varies.\n3.  Distribution: shape of the data (symmetric, uniform, or skewed).\n4.  Qualitative data: analysis of the data\n5.  Outliers: data values that are far from the majority of the data.\n6.  Time: changing characteristics of the data over time.\n\nThis chapter will focus on using the graphs to understand aspects of the data and on how to create the graphs.\n\nThis textbook uses Rguroo to perform all graphical and descriptive statistics, and all statistical inference. When using Rguroo, you will need to either import a dataset from a repository or create a dataset.\n\n```{r setup2, include=FALSE,echo=FALSE}\nlibrary(\"mosaicCore\") \nlibrary(\"mosaic\") \n#library(\"NHANES\") \nlibrary(\"Lock5Data\")\n```\n\n\nRemember, qualitative data are words describing a characteristic of the individual. There are several different graphs that are used for qualitative data. Typical qualitative graphs include bar graphs, Pareto charts, and pie charts. Bar graphs can be created using a statistical program like Rguroo.\n\n**Bar graphs or charts** consist of the frequencies on one axis and the categories on the other axis. Drawing the bar graph using Rguroo is performed by importing the dataset (or creating a dataset) and using the Plots toolbox in Rguroo.\n\n\n### Example: Drawing a Bar Chart\n\nData was collected for two semesters in a statistics class.

There are spreadsheet software packages that will create most of them, and it is better to look at them to see how to create then. It depends on your data as to which may be useful, but the frequecy bar graph, relative frequency bar graph, and pie chart are the most useful.\n\n### Homework for Qualitative Data Section\n\n1.

With quantitative data, you can talk about how the data is distributed, called a distribution. The shape of the distribution can be described from the graphs.\n\n**Histogram:** A graph of frequencies (counts) on the vertical axis and classes on the horizontal axis. The height of the rectangles is the frequency and the width is the class width. The width depends on how many classes (bins) are in the histogram. \n\n**Density Plot:** Similar to a histogram, except smoothing is created to smooth out the graph. The shape is not dependent on the number of bins so the distribution is easier to determine from the density plot. \n\n**Stem and Leaf Plot:** A graph that organizes numerical data by splitting each value into a \"stem\" (leading digit(s)) and a \"leaf\" (the last digit) to show data distribution, frequency, and shape.\n\n### Example: Drawing a Histogram and Density plot\n\nData was collected for two semesters in a statistics class drive.

They all tell you similar ideas of the shape of the distribution. Reviewing the graphs you can see that most of the students live within 10 miles of the Lone Tree Campus, in fact most live within 5 miles from the campus. However, there is a student who lives around 50 miles from the Lone Tree Campus. This is a great deal farther from the rest of the data. This value could be considered an outlier. \n\nAn **outlier** is a data value that is far from the rest of the values. It may be an unusual value or a mistake. It is a data value that should be investigated. In this case, the student lived really far from campus, thus the value is not a mistake, and is just very unusual. \n\nThere are other aspects of a dataset that can be discussed, but first some other concepts need to be introduced.\n\n### Shapes of the distribution:\n\nWhen you look at a distribution, look at the basic shape. There are some basic shapes that are seen in histograms. Realize though that some distributions have no shape. The common shapes are symmetric, skewed, and uniform. Another interest is how many peaks a graph may have. This is known as modal.\n\nSymmetric means that you can fold the graph in half down the middle and the two sides will line up. You can think of the two sides as being mirror images of each other. Skewed means one \"tail\" of the graph is longer than the other. The graph is skewed in the direction of the longer tail (backwards from what you would expect). A uniform graph has all the bars the same height.\n\nModal refers to the number of peaks. Unimodal has one peak and bimodal has two peaks. Usually if a graph has more than two peaks, the modal information is not longer of interest.\n\nOther important features to consider are gaps between bars, a repetitive pattern, how spread out is the data, and where the center of the graph is.

Some of the more common ones are the point plot (scatter plot), and a time-series plot. There are also many different graphs that have emerged lately for qualitative data. Many are found in publications and websites. The following is a description of the point plot (scatter plot), and the time-series plot.\n\n### Point Plots or Scatter Plot\n\nSometimes you have two different variables and you want to see if they are related in any way. A scatter plot helps you to see what the relationship would look like. A scatter plot is just a plotting of the ordered pairs.\n\n### Example: Scatter Plot\n\nIs there a relationship between systolic blood pressure and weight? To answer this question some data is needed. The data frame NHANES contains this data, but given the size of the data frame, it may be not be very useful to look at the graph of all the data. It makes sense to take a sample from the data frame. A random sample is the better type of sample to take. Once the sample is taken, then a scatter plot can be created. The rStudio command for a scatter plot is\n\n<!-- gf_point(response_variable \\~ explanatory_variable, data= Data_Frame)\n\nThe sample is @tbl-sample_NHANES. -->\n\n#### **Solution**\n\n```{r nhanes-data-table-1,echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}\n##| tbl-alt: \"Table showing first 6 rows of sample from NHANES dataset\"\n##| label: tbl-sample_NHANES\n##| tbl-cap: \"Head of NHANES Sample Data frame\"\n#sample_NHANES <- NHANES |> \n  #sample_n(size = 100) \n#knitr::kable(head(sample_NHANES))\n```\n\n```{r, echo=FALSE}\n#| tbl-alt: \"Table showing first 6 rows of sample from SleepStudy dataset\"\n#| label: tbl-sample_sleep_study\n#| tbl-cap: \"Head of SleepStudy Sample Data frame\"\nsleep_study <- SleepStudy\nknitr::kable(head(sleep_study))\n\n```\n\nPreliminary: State the explanatory variable and the response variable\n\nLet x=explanatory variable = Weight of a person (Weight)\n\ny=response variable = Systolic blood pressure (BPSys1)\n\n```{r weight-bp-sys-data, eval=FALSE}\n#| fig-alt: \"See the description of the graph below the graph\"\n#| warning: FALSE\n#| label: fig-blood-data\n#| fig-cap: \"Blood Pressure versus Weight\"\ngf_point(BPSys1~Weight, data=sample_NHANES, xlab=\"Weight (kg)\", ylab=\"Systolic Blood Pressure\", title=\"Blood Pressure versus Weight\")\n```\n\nDescription of @fig-blood-data is a scatter plot with dots all over the plot though a line could be thought of fitting the dots with lower on the left and higher on the right.\n\nLooking at the graph @fig-blood-data, it appears that there is a linear relationship between weight and systolic blood pressure though it looks somewhat weak. It also appears to be a positive relationship, thus as weight increases, the systolic blood pressure increases.\n\n### **Time-Series**\n\nA time-series plot is a graph showing the data measurements in chronological order, the data being quantitative data. For example, a time-series plot is used to show profits over the last 5 years. \n\nThe purpose of a time-series graph is to look for trends over time. Caution, you must realize that the trend may not continue. Just because you see an increase, doesn't mean the increase will continue forever. As an example, prior to 2007, many people noticed that housing prices were increasing. The belief at the time was that housing prices would continue to increase. However, the housing bubble burst in 2007, and many houses lost value, and haven't recovered.\n\n### Example: Time-Series Plot\n\nThe bank assets (in billions of Australia dollars (AUD)) of the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) and other financial organizations for the time period of September 1 1969, through March 1 2019, are contained in table @tbl-Australian (Reserve Bank of Australia, 2019).

If the vertical axis doesn't start at 0, then the change can look much more dramatic than it really is. For a graph to be useful to the reader, it needs to have a title that explains what the graph contains, the axes should be labeled so the reader knows what each axes represents, each axes should have a scale marked, and it is best if the vertical axis contains 0 to show the relationship.\n\n### Homework for Other Graphical Representations of Data Section\n\n1.

Remember, in most cases you can't collect the entire population, so you have to take a sample. Thus, you collect data either through a sample or a census. Now you have a large number of data values. What can you do with them? No one likes to look at just a set of numbers. One thing is to organize the data into a table or graph. Ultimately though, you want to be able to use that graph to interpret the data, to describe the distribution of the data set, and to explore different characteristics of the data. The characteristics that will be discussed in this chapter and the next chapter are:\n\n1.  Center: middle of the data set, also known as the average.\n2.  Variation: how much the data varies.\n3.  Distribution: shape of the data (symmetric, uniform, or skewed).\n4.  Qualitative data: analysis of the data\n5.  Outliers: data values that are far from the majority of the data.\n6.  Time: changing characteristics of the data over time.\n\nThis chapter will focus on using the graphs to understand aspects of the data and on how to create the graphs.\n\nThis textbook uses Rguroo to perform all graphical and descriptive statistics, and all statistical inference. When using Rguroo, you will need to either import a dataset from a repository or create a dataset.\n\n```{r setup2, include=FALSE,echo=FALSE}\nlibrary(\"mosaicCore\") \nlibrary(\"mosaic\") \n#library(\"NHANES\") \nlibrary(\"Lock5Data\")\n```\n\n## Qualitative Data\n\nRemember, qualitative data are words describing a characteristic of the individual. There are several different graphs that are used for qualitative data. Typical qualitative graphs include bar graphs, Pareto charts, and pie charts. Bar graphs can be created using a statistical program like Rguroo.\n\n**Bar graphs or charts** consist of the frequencies on one axis and the categories on the other axis. Drawing the bar graph using Rguroo is performed by importing the dataset (or creating a dataset) and using the Plots toolbox in Rguroo.\n\n\n### Example: Drawing a Bar Chart\n\nData was collected for two semesters in a statistics class.

With quantitative data, you can talk about how the data is distributed, called a distribution. The shape of the distribution can be described from the graphs.\n\n**Histogram:** A graph of frequencies (counts) on the vertical axis and classes on the horizontal axis. The height of the rectangles is the frequency and the width is the class width. The width depends on how many classes (bins) are in the histogram. \n\n**Density Plot:** Similar to a histogram, except smoothing is created to smooth out the graph. The shape is not dependent on the number of bins so the distribution is easier to determine from the density plot. \n\n**Stem and Leaf Plot:** A graph that organizes numerical data by splitting each value into a \"stem\" (leading digit(s)) and a \"leaf\" (the last digit) to show data distribution, frequency, and shape.\n\n### Example: Drawing a Histogram and Density plot\n\nData was collected for two semesters in a statistics class drive. The data frame is in @tbl-Class and the code book is below the data frame\n\nDraw a histogram and density plot for the variable the distance a student lives from the Lone Tree Campus of Coconino Community College.

They all tell you similar ideas of the shape of the distribution. Reviewing the graphs you can see that most of the students live within 10 miles of the Lone Tree Campus, in fact most live within 5 miles from the campus. However, there is a student who lives around 50 miles from the Lone Tree Campus. This is a great deal farther from the rest of the data. This value could be considered an outlier. \n\nAn **outlier** is a data value that is far from the rest of the values. It may be an unusual value or a mistake. It is a data value that should be investigated. In this case, the student lived really far from campus, thus the value is not a mistake, and is just very unusual. \n\nThere are other aspects of a dataset that can be discussed, but first some other concepts need to be introduced.\n\n### Shapes of the distribution:\n\nWhen you look at a distribution, look at the basic shape. There are some basic shapes that are seen in histograms. Realize though that some distributions have no shape. The common shapes are symmetric, skewed, and uniform. Another interest is how many peaks a graph may have. This is known as modal.\n\nSymmetric means that you can fold the graph in half down the middle and the two sides will line up. You can think of the two sides as being mirror images of each other. Skewed means one \"tail\" of the graph is longer than the other. The graph is skewed in the direction of the longer tail (backwards from what you would expect). A uniform graph has all the bars the same height.\n\nModal refers to the number of peaks. Unimodal has one peak and bimodal has two peaks. Usually if a graph has more than two peaks, the modal information is not longer of interest.\n\nOther important features to consider are gaps between bars, a repetitive pattern, how spread out is the data, and where the center of the graph is. These concepts will be explored in Chapter 3.\n\n### Examples of graphs:\n\nThis graph is roughly symmetric and unimodal:\n\n**Graph: Symmetric Distribution**\n\n![symmetric Graph](symmetric.png){fig-alt=\"one side looks like other\"}\n\nThis graph is symmetric and bimodal:\n\n**Graph: Symmetric and Bimodal Distribution**\n\n![Bimodal and symmetric graph](bimodal_symmetric.png){fig-alt=\"two bars high, and one side looks like other\"}\n\nThis graph is skewed to the right:\n\n**Graph: Skewed Right Distribution**\n\n![Skewed right graph](skewed_right.png){fig-alt=\"small bars on right\"}\n\nThis graph is skewed to the left and has a gap:\n\n**Graph: Skewed Left Distribution**\n\n![Skewed Left graph](skewed_left.png){fig-alt=\"small bars on left\"}\n\nThis graph is uniform since all the bars are the same height:\n\n**Graph: Uniform Distribution**\n\n![Uniform graph](Uniform.png){fig-alt=\"All bars same height\"}\n\n### Example: Drawing a Histogram and Density plot\n\nData was collected from the Chronicle of Higher Education for tuition from public four year colleges, private four year colleges, and for profit four year colleges.

Some of the more common ones are the point plot (scatter plot), and a time-series plot. There are also many different graphs that have emerged lately for qualitative data. Many are found in publications and websites. The following is a description of the point plot (scatter plot), and the time-series plot.\n\n### Point Plots or Scatter Plot\n\nSometimes you have two different variables and you want to see if they are related in any way. A scatter plot helps you to see what the relationship would look like. A scatter plot is just a plotting of the ordered pairs.\n\n### Example: Scatter Plot\n\nIs there a relationship between systolic blood pressure and weight? To answer this question some data is needed. The data frame NHANES contains this data, but given the size of the data frame, it may be not be very useful to look at the graph of all the data. It makes sense to take a sample from the data frame. A random sample is the better type of sample to take. Once the sample is taken, then a scatter plot can be created. The rStudio command for a scatter plot is\n\n<!-- gf_point(response_variable \\~ explanatory_variable, data= Data_Frame)\n\nThe sample is @tbl-sample_NHANES. -->\n\n#### **Solution**\n\n```{r nhanes-data-table-1,echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}\n##| tbl-alt: \"Table showing first 6 rows of sample from NHANES dataset\"\n##| label: tbl-sample_NHANES\n##| tbl-cap: \"Head of NHANES Sample Data frame\"\n#sample_NHANES <- NHANES |> \n  #sample_n(size = 100) \n#knitr::kable(head(sample_NHANES))\n```\n\n```{r, echo=FALSE}\n#| tbl-alt: \"Table showing first 6 rows of sample from SleepStudy dataset\"\n#| label: tbl-sample_sleep_study\n#| tbl-cap: \"Head of SleepStudy Sample Data frame\"\nsleep_study <- SleepStudy\nknitr::kable(head(sleep_study))\n\n```\n\nPreliminary: State the explanatory variable and the response variable\n\nLet x=explanatory variable = Weight of a person (Weight)\n\ny=response variable = Systolic blood pressure (BPSys1)\n\n```{r weight-bp-sys-data, eval=FALSE}\n#| fig-alt: \"See the description of the graph below the graph\"\n#| warning: FALSE\n#| label: fig-blood-data\n#| fig-cap: \"Blood Pressure versus Weight\"\ngf_point(BPSys1~Weight, data=sample_NHANES, xlab=\"Weight (kg)\", ylab=\"Systolic Blood Pressure\", title=\"Blood Pressure versus Weight\")\n```\n\nDescription of @fig-blood-data is a scatter plot with dots all over the plot though a line could be thought of fitting the dots with lower on the left and higher on the right.\n\nLooking at the graph @fig-blood-data, it appears that there is a linear relationship between weight and systolic blood pressure though it looks somewhat weak. It also appears to be a positive relationship, thus as weight increases, the systolic blood pressure increases.\n\n### **Time-Series**\n\nA time-series plot is a graph showing the data measurements in chronological order, the data being quantitative data. For example, a time-series plot is used to show profits over the last 5 years. \n\nThe purpose of a time-series graph is to look for trends over time. Caution, you must realize that the trend may not continue. Just because you see an increase, doesn't mean the increase will continue forever. As an example, prior to 2007, many people noticed that housing prices were increasing. The belief at the time was that housing prices would continue to increase. However, the housing bubble burst in 2007, and many houses lost value, and haven't recovered.\n\n### Example: Time-Series Plot\n\nThe bank assets (in billions of Australia dollars (AUD)) of the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) and other financial organizations for the time period of September 1 1969, through March 1 2019, are contained in table @tbl-Australian (Reserve Bank of Australia, 2019).

If the vertical axis doesn't start at 0, then the change can look much more dramatic than it really is. For a graph to be useful to the reader, it needs to have a title that explains what the graph contains, the axes should be labeled so the reader knows what each axes represents, each axes should have a scale marked, and it is best if the vertical axis contains 0 to show the relationship.\n\n### Homework for Other Graphical Representations of Data Section\n\n1.
