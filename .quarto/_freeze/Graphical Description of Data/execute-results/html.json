Remember, in most cases you can't collect the entire population, so you have to take a sample. Thus, you collect data either through a sample or a census. Now you have a large number of data values. What can you do with them? No one likes to look at just a set of numbers. One thing is to organize the data into a table or graph. Ultimately though, you want to be able to use that graph to interpret the data, to describe the distribution of the data set, and to explore different characteristics of the data. The characteristics that will be discussed in this chapter and the next chapter are:\n\n1.  Center: middle of the data set, also known as the average.\n2.  Variation: how much the data varies.\n3.  Distribution: shape of the data (symmetric, uniform, or skewed).\n4.  Qualitative data: analysis of the data\n5.  Outliers: data values that are far from the majority of the data.\n6.  Time: changing characteristics of the data over time.\n\nThis chapter will focus mostly on using the graphs to understand aspects of the data, and not as much on how to create the graphs. There is technology that will create most of the graphs, though it is important for you to understand the basics of how to create them.\n\nThis textbook uses RStudio to perform all graphical and descriptive statistics, and all statistical inference. When using RStudio, every command is performed the same way. You start off with a goal(explanatory variable \\~ response variable, data=data frame_name,...)\n\nRStudio uses packages to make calculations easier. For this textbook, you will mostly need the package mosaic. There will be others that you will need on occasion, but you will be told that at the time. Most likely, mosaic is already installed in your RStudio. If you wish to install other packages you use the command\n\ninstall.packages(\"name of package\")\n\nwhere you replace the name of package with the package you wish to install.\n\nOnce the package is installed, then you will need to tell RStudio you want to use it every time you start RStudio. The command to tell RStudio you want to use a package is\n\nlibrary(\"name of package\")\n\nYou will need to turn on the package mosaic. The NHANES package contains a data frame that is useful. Both are accessed by running the command library(\"name of package\").\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to the basic command\n\ngoal(explanatory variable \\~ response variable, data=data frame_name,...)\n\nThe goal depends on what you want to do. If you want to create a graph then you would need\n\ngf_graph_type(explanatory_variable \\~ response_variable, data=data_frame_name, ...)\n\nAs an example if you want to create a density plot of cholesterol levels on day 2 from a data frame called Cholesterol, then your command would be\n\ngf_density(\\~day2, data=Cholesterol)\n\nYou will see more on what the different commands are that you would use. A word about the ... at the end of the command. That means there are other things you can do, but that is up to you if you want to actually do them. They do not need to be used if you don't want to. The following sections will show you how to create the different graphs that are usually completed in an introductory statistics course.\n\n## Qualitative Data\n\nRemember, qualitative data are words describing a characteristic of the individual. There are several different graphs that are used for qualitative data. These graphs include bar graphs, Pareto charts, and pie charts. Bar graphs can be created using a statistical program like RStudio.\n\n**Bar graphs or charts** consist of the frequencies on one axis and the categories on the other axis. Drawing the bar graph using r is performed using the following command.\n\ngf_bar(\\~explanatory variable, data=Dataframe)\n\n### Example: Drawing a Bar Chart\n\nData was collected for two semesters in a statistics class. The data frame is in @tbl-Class. The command\n\nhead(data frame)\n\nshows the variables and the first few lines of the data set. The data sets are usually larger than what is shown. The head command allows one to see the structure of the data frame.\n\n\n::: {#tbl-Class .cell tbl-alt='Table showing first 6 rows of statistics class survey dataset' tbl-cap='Head of Statistics Class Survey'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nClass<-read.csv( \"https://krkozak.github.io/MAT160/class_survey.csv\") \nknitr::kable(head(Class))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n|vehicle |gender | distance_campus|ice_cream          | rent|major                                    | height|winter        |\n|:-------|:------|---------------:|:------------------|----:|:----------------------------------------|------:|:-------------|\n|None    |Female |             1.5|Cookie Dough       |  724|Environmental and Sustainability Studies |     61|Liked it      |\n|Mercury |Female |            14.7|Sherbet            |  200|Administrative Justice                   |     60|Don't like it |\n|Ford    |Female |             2.4|Chocolate Brownie. |  600|Bio Chem                                 |     68|Liked it      |\n|Toyota  |Female |             5.2|coffee             |    0|                                         |     66|Loved it      |\n|Jeep    |Male   |             2.0|Cookie Dough       |  600|Pre-health Careers                       |     71|Loved it      |\n|Subaru  |Male   |             5.0|none               |  500|Finance                                  |     72|No opinion    |\n:::\n:::\n\n\nEvery data frame has a code book that describes the data set, the source of the data set, and a listing and description of the variables in the data frame.\n\n**Code book for data frame class**\n\nDescription Survey results from two semesters of statistics classes at Coconino Community College in the years 2018-2019.\n\nFormat\n\nThis data frame contains the following columns:\n\nvehicle: Type of car a student drives\n\ngender: Self declared gender of a student\n\ndistance_campus: how far a student lives from the Lone Tree Campus of Coconino Community College (miles)\n\nice_cream: favorite ice cream flavor\n\nrent: How much a student pays in rent\n\nmajor: Students declared major\n\nheight: height of the student (inches)\n\nwinter: Student's opinion of winter (Love it, Like it, Don't like, No opinion)\n\nSource\n\nKozak K (2019).

To do this in RStudio, use the command\n\ngf_bar(\\~variable, data=Data_Frame, ...)\n\nwhere gf_bar is the goal, vehicle is the name of the response variable (there is no explanatory variable), the data frame is Class, and a title was added to the graph.\n\n#### Solution\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngf_bar(~vehicle, data=Class, title=\"Bar Chart of Cars driven by students in statistics class\", xlab=\"Vehicle\") \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Cars driven by students in statistics class](Graphical-Description-of-Data_files/figure-html/fig-class_data-1.png){#fig-class_data fig-alt='See the description of the graph below the graph' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nDescription of @fig-class_data is a Bar graph with bars for Audi, Buick, Honda, Hyundai, Mercury, Nissan with height of 1, Dodge and None with height of 2, Jeep, Subaru, Toyota with heights of 3, and Chevrolet and Ford at height of 4.\n\nNotice from @fig-class_data, you can see that Chevrolet and Ford are the more popular car, with Jeep, Subaru, and Toyota not far behind. Many types seems to be the lesser used, and tied for last place. However, more data would help to figure this out.\n\n**All graphs should have labels on each axis and a title for the graph.**\n\nThe beauty of data frames with multiple variables is that you can answer many questions from the data. Suppose you want to see if gender makes a difference for the type of car a person drives. If you are a car manufacturer, if you knew that certain genders like certain cars, then you would advertise to the different genders. To create a bar graph that separates based on gender, perform the following command in RStudio.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngf_bar(~vehicle, fill=~gender, data=Class, title=\"Cars driving by students in statistics class\",xlab=\"Vehicle\", position=position_dodge())\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Bar graph of Cars driven by students in statistics class](Graphical-Description-of-Data_files/figure-html/fig-class_data_dodge-1.png){#fig-class_data_dodge fig-alt='See the description of the graph below the graph' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nDescription of @fig-class_data_dodge is a bar graph of number of vehicles separated by female and male. Audi and male has height of 1, Buick and female has a height of 1, Chevrolet and male and Chevrolet and female have heights of 2, Dodge and male and Dodge and female has heights of 1, Ford and female has a height of 4, Honda and female has a height of 1, Hyundai and male has a height of 1, Jeep and male has a height of 2 while Jeep and female has a height of 1, Mercury and female has a height of 1, Nissan and female has a height of 1, no car and female has a height of 2, Subaru and female has a height of 1, Subaru and male has a height of 2, Toyota and female has a height of 1, and Toyota and male has a height of 2.\n\nNotice a Ford is driven by females more than any other car, while Chevrolet, Mercury, and Subaru cars are equally driven by males. Obviously a larger sample would be needed to make any conclusions from this data.\n\nThere are other types of graphs that can be created for quantitative variables. Another type is known as a dot plot. The command for this graph is as follows.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngf_dotplot(~vehicle, data=Class, title=\"Cars driven by students in statistics class\", xlab=\"Vehicle\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Cars driven by students in statistics class](Graphical-Description-of-Data_files/figure-html/fig-class_data_dot-car-1.png){#fig-class_data_dot-car fig-alt='See the description of the graph below the graph' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nDescription of @fig-class_data_dot is a dot plot of number of vehicles with Audi, Buick, Honda, Hyundai, Mercury, Nissan with height of 1, Dodge and None with height of 2, Jeep, Subaru, Toyota with heights of 3, and Chevrolet and Ford at height of 4. Very similar to bar graph.\n\nNotice a dot plot is like a bar chart. Both give you the same information. You can also divide a dot plot by gender.\n\nAnother type of graph that is also useful and similar to the dot plot is a point plot (scatter plot). In this plot you can graph the explanatory variable versus the response variable. The command for this in rStudio is as follows.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngf_point(vehicle~gender, data=Class, title=\"Cars driving by students in statistics class\", xlab=\"Gender\", ylab=\"Vehicle\") \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Cars driven by students in statistics class](Graphical-Description-of-Data_files/figure-html/fig-class_data_point-1.png){#fig-class_data_point fig-alt='See the description of the graph below the graph' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nDescription of @fig-class_data_point is a scatter plot of type of vehicles separated by female and male with females owning Toyota, Subaru, none, Nissan, Mercury, Jeep, Honda, Ford, Dodge, Chevrolet, and Buick, while males own Toyota, Subaru, Jeep, Hyundai, Dodge, Chevrolet, and Audi.\n\nThe problem with @fig-class_data_point is that if there are multiple females who drive a Ford, only one dot is shown. So it is best to spread the dots out using a plot known as a jitter plot. In a jitter plot the dots are randomly moved off the center line. The command for a jitter plot is as follows:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngf_jitter(vehicle~gender, data=Class, title=\"Cars driving by students in statistics class\", xlab=\"Gender\", ylab=\"Vehicle\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Cars driven by students in statistics class](Graphical-Description-of-Data_files/figure-html/fig-class_data_jitter-1.png){#fig-class_data_jitter fig-alt='See the description of the graph below the graph' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nDescription of @fig-class_data_jitter is a jitter plot of number of vehicles separated by female and male with females owning 1 Toyota, 1 Subaru, 2 with none, 1 Nissan, 1 Mercury, 1 Jeep, 1 Honda, 4 Fords, 1 Dodge, 2 Chevrolets, and 1 Buick, while males own 2 Toyotas, 2 Subarus, 2 Jeeps, 1 Hyundai, 1 Dodge, 1 Chevrolets, and 1 Audi.\n\nNow you can observe that there are 4 females who drive a Ford. There is one female who drives a Honda. Other information about other cars and genders can be seen better than in the point plot and the bar graph. Jitter plots are useful to see how many data values are for each qualitative data values.\n\nThere are many other types of graphs that can be used on qualitative data. There are spreadsheet software packages that will create most of them, and it is better to look at them to see how to create then. It depends on your data as to which may be useful, but the bar, dot, and jitter plots are really the most useful.\n\n### Homework for Qualitative Data Section\n\n1.

graphs for quantitative data. With quantitative data, you can talk about how the data is distributed, called a distribution. The shape of the distribution can be described from the graphs.\n\n**Histogram:** a graph of frequencies (counts) on the vertical axis and classes on the horizontal axis. The height of the rectangles is the frequency and the width is the class width. The width depends on how many classes (bins) are in the histogram. The shape of a histogram is dependent on the number of bins. In RStudio the command to create a histogram is\n\ngf_histogram(\\~response variable, data=Data_Frame, title=\"title of the graph\")\n\nThe last part of the command puts a title on the graph. You type in what ever you want for the title in the quotes.\n\n**Density Plot:** Similar to a histogram, except smoothing is created to smooth out the graph. The shape is not dependent on the number of bins so the distribution is easier to determine from the density plot. In RStudio the command to create a density plot is\n\ngf_density(\\~response variable, data=Data_Frame, title=\"title of the graph\", xlab=\"Label\", ylab=\"Label\")\n\nThe last part of the command puts a title on the graph and labels on the axes. You type in what every you want for the title and labels in the quotes.\n\nThe last part of the command puts a title on the graph and labels on the axes. You type in what every you want for the title and labels in the quotes.\n\n### Example: Drawing a Histogram and Density plot\n\nData was collected for two semesters in a statistics class drive. The data frame is in @tbl-Class and the code book is below the data frame\n\nDraw a histogram, density plot, and a dot plot for the variable the distance a student lives from the Lone Tree Campus of Coconino Community College. Describe the story the graphs tell.\n\n#### **Solution**\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngf_histogram(~distance_campus, data=Class, title=\"Distance in miles from the Lone Tree Campus\", xlab=\"Distance (miles)\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Distance in miles from the Lone Tree Campus](Graphical-Description-of-Data_files/figure-html/fig-class_data_histogram-1.png){#fig-class_data_histogram fig-alt='See the description of the graph below the graph' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nDescription of the graph is histogram with high part on left and low part on right with several gaps.

The graph is with dots that represent each data value.\n\nNotice the histogram, density plot, and dot plot are all very similar, but the density plot is smoother. They all tell you similar ideas of the shape of the distribution. Reviewing the graphs you can see that most of the students live within 10 miles of the Lone Tree Campus, in fact most live within 5 miles from the campus. However, there is a student who lives around 50 miles from the Lone Tree Campus. This is a great deal farther from the rest of the data. This value could be considered an outlier. An outlier is a data value that is far from the rest of the values. It may be an unusual value or a mistake. It is a data value that should be investigated. In this case, the student lived really far from campus, thus the value is not a mistake, and is just very unusual. The density plot is probably the best plot for most data frames.\n\nThere are other aspects that can be discussed, but first some other concepts need to be introduced.\n\n### Shapes of the distribution:\n\nWhen you look at a distribution, look at the basic shape. There are some basic shapes that are seen in histograms. Realize though that some distributions have no shape. The common shapes are symmetric, skewed, and uniform. Another interest is how many peaks a graph may have. This is known as modal.\n\nSymmetric means that you can fold the graph in half down the middle and the two sides will line up. You can think of the two sides as being mirror images of each other. Skewed means one \"tail\" of the graph is longer than the other. The graph is skewed in the direction of the longer tail (backwards from what you would expect). A uniform graph has all the bars the same height.\n\nModal refers to the number of peaks. Unimodal has one peak and bimodal has two peaks. Usually if a graph has more than two peaks, the modal information is not longer of interest.\n\nOther important features to consider are gaps between bars, a repetitive pattern, how spread out is the data, and where the center of the graph is.\n\n### Examples of graphs:\n\nThis graph is roughly symmetric and unimodal:\n\n**Graph: Symmetric Distribution**\n\n![symmetric Graph](symmetric.png){fig-alt=\"one side looks like other\"}\n\nThis graph is symmetric and bimodal:\n\n**Graph: Symmetric and Bimodal Distribution**\n\n![Bimodal and symmetric graph](bimodal_symmetric.png){fig-alt=\"two bars high, and one side looks like other\"}\n\nThis graph is skewed to the right:\n\n**Graph: Skewed Right Distribution**\n\n![Skewed right graph](skewed_right.png){fig-alt=\"small bars on right\"}\n\nThis graph is skewed to the left and has a gap:\n\n**Graph: Skewed Left Distribution**\n\n![Skewed Left graph](skewed_left.png){fig-alt=\"small bars on left\"}\n\nThis graph is uniform since all the bars are the same height:\n\n**Graph: Uniform Distribution**\n\n![Uniform graph](Uniform.png){fig-alt=\"All bars same height\"}\n\n### Example: Drawing a Histogram and Density plot\n\nData was collected from the Chronicle of Higher Education for tuition from public four year colleges, private four year colleges, and for profit four year colleges.

regions around the world\n\nCountry_Code: The 3 letter code for a country or region\n\nRegion: World Banks classification of where the country is in the world\n\nIncomegroup: World Banks classification of what income level the country is considered to be\n\ny1961-y2018: population density for the years 1961 through 2018, people per sq. km of land area, population density is midyear population divided by land area in square kilometers. Population is based on the de facto definition of population, which counts all residents regardless of legal status or citizenship--except for refugees not permanently settled in the country of asylum, who are generally considered part of the population of their country of origin. Land area is a country's total area, excluding area under inland water bodies, national claims to continental shelf, and exclusive economic zones. In most cases the definition of inland water bodies includes major rivers and lakes.\n\nSource Population density (people per sq. km of land area). (n.d.).

Some of the more common ones are the point plot (scatter plot), and a time-series plot. There are also many different graphs that have emerged lately for qualitative data. Many are found in publications and websites. The following is a description of the point plot (scatter plot), and the time-series plot.\n\n### Point Plots or Scatter Plot\n\nSometimes you have two different variables and you want to see if they are related in any way. A scatter plot helps you to see what the relationship would look like. A scatter plot is just a plotting of the ordered pairs.\n\n### Example: Scatter Plot\n\nIs there a relationship between systolic blood pressure and weight? To answer this question some data is needed. The data frame NHANES contains this data, but given the size of the data frame, it may be not be very useful to look at the graph of all the data. It makes sense to take a sample from the data frame. A random sample is the better type of sample to take. Once the sample is taken, then a scatter plot can be created. The rStudio command for a scatter plot is\n\ngf_point(response_variable \\~ explanatory_variable, data= Data_Frame)\n\nThe sample is @tbl-sample_NHANES.\n\n#### **Solution**\n\n\n:::

Weight](Graphical-Description-of-Data_files/figure-html/fig-blood-data-1.png){#fig-blood-data fig-alt='See the description of the graph below the graph' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nDescription of @fig-blood-data is a scatter plot with dots all over the plot though a line could be thought of fitting the dots with lower on the left and higher on the right.\n\nLooking at the graph @fig-blood-data, it appears that there is a linear relationship between weight and systolic blood pressure though it looks somewhat weak. It also appears to be a positive relationship, thus as weight increases, the systolic blood pressure increases.\n\n### **Time-Series**\n\nA time-series plot is a graph showing the data measurements in chronological order, the data being quantitative data. For example, a time-series plot is used to show profits over the last 5 years. To create a time-series plot on RStudio, use the command\n\ngf_line(response_variable \\~ explanatory_variable, data=Data_Frame)\n\nThe purpose of a time-series graph is to look for trends over time. Caution, you must realize that the trend may not continue. Just because you see an increase, doesn't mean the increase will continue forever. As an example, prior to 2007, many people noticed that housing prices were increasing. The belief at the time was that housing prices would continue to increase. However, the housing bubble burst in 2007, and many houses lost value, and haven't recovered.\n\n### Example: Time-Series Plot\n\nThe bank assets (in billions of Australia dollars (AUD)) of the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) and other financial organizations for the time period of September 1 1969, through March 1 2019, are contained in table @tbl-Australian (Reserve Bank of Australia, 2019). Create a time-series plot of the total assets of Authorized Deposit-taking Institutions (ADIs) and interpret any findings.\n\n\n::: {#tbl-Australian .cell tbl-alt='Table showing first 6 rows of Australian dataset' tbl-cap='Head of Australian Data frame'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nAustralian<- read.csv( \"https://krkozak.github.io/MAT160/Australian_financial.csv\") \nknitr::kable(head(Australian))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n|Date   | Day| Assets_RBA| Assets_ADIs_Banks| Assets_ADIs_Building| Assets_ADIs_CU| Assets_ADIs_Total| Assets_RFCs_MM| Assets_RFCs_Finance| Assets_RFCs_Total| Assets_Life.offices| Assets_Life_funds| Assets_Life_Total| Assets_Other_Public_trusts| Assets_Other_Cash_trusts| Assets_Other_Common_funds| Assets_Others_Friendly| Assets_Other_General_insurance| Assets_Other_vehicles| Assets_Unconsolidated|\n|:------|---:|----------:|-----------------:|--------------------:|--------------:|-----------------:|--------------:|-------------------:|-----------------:|-------------------:|-----------------:|-----------------:|--------------------------:|------------------------:|-------------------------:|----------------------:|------------------------------:|---------------------:|---------------------:|\n|Sep-69 |   0|        2.7|                NA|                   NA|             NA|                NA|             NA|                  NA|                NA|                  NA|                NA|                NA|                         NA|                       NA|                        NA|                     NA|                             NA|                    NA|                    NA|\n|Dec-69 |  90|        2.9|                NA|                   NA|             NA|                NA|             NA|                  NA|                NA|                  NA|                NA|                NA|                         NA|                       NA|                        NA|                     NA|                             NA|                    NA|                    NA|\n|Mar-70 | 180|        3.0|                NA|                   NA|             NA|                NA|             NA|                  NA|                NA|                  NA|                NA|                NA|                         NA|                       NA|                        NA|                     NA|                             NA|                    NA|                    NA|\n|Jun-70 | 270|        3.0|                NA|                   NA|             NA|                NA|             NA|                  NA|                NA|                  NA|                NA|                NA|                         NA|                       NA|                        NA|                     NA|                             NA|                    NA|                    NA|\n|Sep-70 | 360|        3.0|                NA|                   NA|             NA|                NA|             NA|                  NA|                NA|                  NA|                NA|                NA|                         NA|                       NA|                        NA|                     NA|                             NA|                    NA|                    NA|\n|Dec-70 | 450|        3.0|                NA|                   NA|             NA|                NA|             NA|                  NA|                NA|                  NA|                NA|                NA|                         NA|                       NA|                        NA|                     NA|                             NA|                    NA|                    NA|\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Code book for Data frame Australian**\n\n**Description** The data is a range of economic and financial data produced by the Reserve Bank of Australia and other organizations.\n\nFormat\n\nThis data frame contains the following columns:\n\nDate: quarters from September 1, 1969, to March 1, 2019\n\nDay: The number of days since September 1, 1969, using 90 days between starts of a quarter.

With a time series plot, the other variable is time. In this case the variable in the data frame that represents time is Date. The problem with Date is that the units are every quarter. This is not easily interpreted by rStudio, so a column was created called Day. From the code book, this is the number of days since September 1, 1969, using 90 days between starts of a quarter. Even though this isn't perfect, it will work for determining trends. So create a time series plot of Assets_ADIs_Total versus Day. The command is:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngf_line(Assets_ADIs_Total~Day, data=Australian, title=\"Total Assets of Authorized Deposit-taking Institutions (ADIs)\", xlab=\"Day since September 1, 1969\", ylab=\"ADI (AUD)\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Total Assets of Authorized Deposit-taking Institutions](Graphical-Description-of-Data_files/figure-html/fig-Australian_data-1.png){#fig-Australian_data fig-alt='See the description of the graph below the graph' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nDescription of @fig-Australian_data is an increasing time series Graph of Total Assets of Authorized Deposit-taking Institutions from day 7500 to 17500. The first number starts at 0 and goes up to about 4500.\n\nFrom the graph, total assets of Authorized Deposit-taking Institutions (ADIs) appear to be increasing with a slight dip around 14000 days since September 1, 1969. That would be around the year 2008 (14000 days /360 days per year + 1969).\n\nBe careful when making a graph. If the vertical axis doesn't start at 0, then the change can look much more dramatic than it really is. For a graph to be useful to the reader, it needs to have a title that explains what the graph contains, the axes should be labeled so the reader knows what each axes represents, each axes should have a scale marked, and it is best if the vertical axis contains 0 to show the relationship.\n\n### Homework for Other Graphical Representations of Data Section\n\n1.  When an anthropologist finds skeletal remains, they need to figure out the height of the person. The height of a person (in cm) and the length of one of their metacarpal bone (in cm) were collected and are in @tbl-Metacarpal (Prediction of height, 2013). Create a scatter plot of length and height and state if there is a relationship between the height of a person and the length of their metacarpal.\n\n\n::: {#tbl-Metacarpal .cell tbl-alt='Table showing first 6 rows of Metacarpal dataset' tbl-cap='Head of Metacarpal Data frame'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nMetacarpal<- read.csv( \"https://krkozak.github.io/MAT160/metacarpal.csv\") \nknitr::kable(head(Metacarpal))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n| length| height|\n|------:|------:|\n|     45|    171|\n|     51|    178|\n|     39|    157|\n|     41|    163|\n|     48|    172|\n|     49|    183|\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Code book for Data frame Metacarpal**\n\n**Description** When anthropologists analyze human skeletal remains, an important piece of information is living stature.
