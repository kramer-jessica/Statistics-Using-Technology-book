:::

In chapter 1, you were introduced to the concepts of population, which again is a collection of all the measurements from the individuals of interest. Remember, in most cases you can't collect the entire population, so you have to take a sample. Thus, you collect data either through a sample or a census. Now you have a large number of data values. What can you do with them? No one likes to look at just a set of numbers. One thing is to organize the data into a table or graph. Ultimately though, you want to be able to use that graph to interpret the data, to describe the distribution of the data set, and to explore different characteristics of the data. <!--**I didn't think we needed any of this.** The characteristics that will be discussed in this chapter and the next chapter are:-->

<!--1.  Center: middle of the data set, also known as the average.
2.  Variation: how much the data varies.
3.  Distribution: shape of the data (symmetric, uniform, or skewed).
4.  Qualitative data: analysis of the data
5.  Outliers: data values that are far from the majority of the data.
6.  Time: changing characteristics of the data over time.-->

This chapter will focus on organizing data, creating graphs of the data, and using the graphs to understand aspects of the data.

This textbook uses Rguroo to perform all graphical and descriptive statistics, and all statistical inference. When using Rguroo, you will need to either import a dataset from a repository or create a dataset. For directions on how to create a dataset in Rguroo, please refer to Chapter 0.

## Qualitative Data

Remember, qualitative data are words describing a characteristic of the individual. Once you’ve gathered raw data, the real work begins. A long list of observations doesn’t tell you much on its own. Raw data are usually messy, unstructured, and difficult to understand or use. The next step is to organize the data in a way that reveals patterns and meaning. 

### Organizing Qualitative Data

A simple way to organize qualitative data is to create a table, called a frequency distribution or relative frequency distribution. Both of these organize non‑numerical categories into groups and show how often each category occurs.

A **frequency distribution for qualitative data** is a table that lists each category with its corresponding frequency.

A **relative frequency distribution for qualitative data** is a table that lists each category with its corresponding relative frequency. Relative frequencies are calculated by dividing the frequency of each category by the total frequency. Relative frequencies can be in the form of a reduced fraction, proportion, or a percentage.

These displays of qualitative data help you quickly see which categories are most common, how the data is spread across different groups, and whether any categories stand out as unusually frequent or rare.

### Graphical Displays of Qualitative Data

Another way to display data is with a graph. There are several different graphs that are used for qualitative data. Typical qualitative graphs include bar graphs, Pareto charts, and pie charts. Bar graphs can be created using a statistical program like Rguroo.

**Bar graphs or charts** consist of the frequencies on one axis and the categories on the other axis. Drawing the bar graph using Rguroo is performed by importing the dataset (or creating a dataset) and using the Plots toolbox in Rguroo.

@fig-bar_graph is a Bar graph with bars for Audi, Buick, Honda, Hyundai, Mercury, Nissan with height of 1, Dodge and None with height of 2, Jeep, Subaru, Toyota with heights of 3, and Chevrolet and Ford at height of 4.

Notice from @fig-bar_graph, you can see that Chevrolet and Ford are the more popular car, with Jeep, Subaru, and Toyota not far behind. Many types seem to be less commonly used, and tied for last place. However, more data would help to figure this out.

**All graphs should have labels on each axis and a title for the graph.**

Another version of a bar graph that is useful is a relative frequency bar graph. A relative frequency bar graph gives you a clear way to compare how different categories or values occur, especially when working with datasets of different sizes. By converting raw counts into proportions, the graph highlights patterns that might otherwise be hidden. This makes it a powerful tool for spotting meaningful relationships in data, comparing data of different sizes, and communicating those insights in a way that’s easy for others to understand.

Rguroo can generate a relative frequency bar graph from the same plot toolbox.

::: {#exm-drawing-a-relative-frequency-bar-chart}
## Drawing a Relative Frequency Bar Chart for Vehicle Type

Use the [class_survey1]{.data} to create a relative frequency bar chart of [vehicle]{.var} type.

![Rguroo dataset logo](Rguroo_Icons/Rguroo_repo_logo.png) The dataset for this example is available in the Rguroo dataset repository [Kozak]{.repo}, with the dataset name [class_survey1]{.data}. A complete description of the variables is provided in the [dataset code book](#code-book-class).

:::

**Solution**

To create a relative frequency bar graph, follow the directions for creating a bar graph [here](#Creating-Bar-Graph-of-Vehicle-Type-in-Rguroo).  Then click proportion to change frequency to relative frequency.  Don't forget to change your y-axis label to proportion as well.

```{r,echo=FALSE}
#| fig-alt: "Dialog box for creating a relative frequency distribution"

knitr::include_graphics(
  "Rguroo_outputs/Graphical_Description_of_Data/barplot_rel_freq_vehicle_2.svg"
)
```

@fig-class_data_dot-car is a relative frequency bar graph of vehicles showing the vehicle types on the horizontal axis and proportions (relative frequency) on the vertical axis.

Notice that a frequency bar graph and relative frequency bar graph give you similar information. However, a relative frequency bar graph shows you the proportions of the total vehicles.

The beauty of data frames with multiple variables is that you can answer many questions from the data. Suppose you want to see if gender makes a difference for the type of car a person drives. If you are a car manufacturer, if you knew that certain genders like certain cars, then you would advertise to the different genders.

::: {#exm-drawing-a-bar-chart-by-gender}
## Drawing a Bar Chart of Vehicle Type by Gender

**Solution**

To create a bar graph of [vehicle]{.var} by [gender]{.var}, follow the directions for creating a bar graph [here](#Creating-Bar-Graph-of-Vehicle-Type-in-Rguroo).

@fig-class_data_bar_gender is a bar graph of number of vehicles separated by female and male. Audi and male has height of 1, Buick and female has a height of 1, Chevrolet and male and Chevrolet and female have heights of 2, Dodge and male and Dodge and female has heights of 1, Ford and female has a height of 4, Honda and female has a height of 1, Hyundai and male has a height of 1, Jeep and male has a height of 2 while Jeep and female has a height of 1, Mercury and female has a height of 1, Nissan and female has a height of 1, no car and female has a height of 2, Subaru and female has a height of 1, Subaru and male has a height of 2, Toyota and female has a height of 1, and Toyota and male has a height of 2.

Notice a Ford is driven by females more than any other car, while Chevrolet, Mercury, and Subaru cars are equally driven by males. Obviously a larger sample would be needed to make any conclusions from this data.

Another form of a bar graph that disaggregates by a factor is called a stacked bar graph. A stacked bar graph shows how different sub‑groups contribute to an overall total by stacking the segments on top of each other within each bar.

There are spreadsheet software packages that will create most of them, and it is better to look at them to see how to create them. It depends on your data as to which may be useful, but the frequency bar graph, relative frequency bar graph, and pie chart are the most useful.

## Quantitative Data

As with qualitative data, it is also advantageous to organize quantitative data since the long list of raw data is usually long and does not provide insight into the sample or population.

### Organizing Quantitative Data

Frequency and relative frequency distributions can also be used for quantitative data, where the categories are numerical values that occur in the data with their corresponding frequency counts or proportions.  However, most datasets contain many distinct values, so a regular frequency or relative frequency distribution would be meaningless.

For quantitative data that are widely spread, we can group the data values into classes, also known as binning. When you group data into classes/bins, you create a **grouped frequency distribution**.

Lower and upper class limits define the boundaries of each class in a grouped frequency distribution. The **lower class limit** is the smallest value that can belong to a class, while the **upper class limit** is the largest value that can belong to that same class. Together, these limits specify exactly which data values fall into each interval. Most of the time, classes are displayed using interval notation.  For example, suppose we wanted to group the ages of students into a group from 20-25.  This could be displayed using interval notation, [20,25). This interval would capture every student whose age is 20 to 25 years, including 20 years old, but not 25 years old. These limits keep the classes organized, prevent overlap, and ensure every data point has a clear place within the distribution.

Each class has a **class width**, the size of the class (or the number of values within each class).  If you have a grouped frequency distribution, the class width can be determined by subtracting two consecutive lower class limits.  

Rguroo has three automatic methods to calculate the number of bins; however, we will use Freedman–Diaconis since is usually the most reliable with messy real-world data.  Manual calculation of bins is also possible in Rguroo.

## Creating a Grouped Frequency Distribution

Use the [class_survey1]{.data} to create a grouped frequency distribution for the distance a student lives from the Lone Tree Campus of Coconino Community College.

![Rguroo dataset logo](Rguroo_Icons/Rguroo_repo_logo.png) The dataset for this example is available in the Rguroo dataset repository [Kozak]{.repo}, with the dataset name [class_survey1]{.data}. A complete description of the variables is provided in the [dataset code book](#code-book-class).

:::

**Solution**

Click to expand the box below see how to create a grouped frequency distribution for [distance_campus]{.var}.

**Before you begin:** Make sure you have already imported the [class_survey1]{.data} dataset into your Rguroo account, as was shown [here](#Importing-Data-to-Rguroo-Chapter-2).

1. Open the **Analytics** toolbox in Rguroo.  
2. Open the [Analysis]{.dpd} dropdown, and select [Tabulation]{.fun} and [Numerical (Binning)]{.fun}. This opens the Binning dialog.  
3. In the Binning dialog, choose the [class_survey1]{.data} dataset from the [Dataset]{.dpd} dropdown.  
4. Choose the [distance_campus]{.var} variable from the [Factor 1]{.dpd} dropdown.  **Note:** For frequency, select counts. For realtive frequency, select proportions.    
5. Click the preview icon ![preview icon](Rguroo_Icons/preview_inline.png) to see a preview of the frequency distribution.

The grouped frequency distribution above used the default method, Freedman-Diaconis, creating 11 classes.  Each class has a class width of 5. Now that the data is organized, it is easily seen that most students live within 15 miles of campus. There are also two students who live farther from campus than the rest of the class.

As mentioned above, Rguroo also allows for manual creation of bins.  If we wanted a specific number of bins, we could manually enter that in the Binning toolbox under Bins.  In order to manually choose the bins, we need to determine two things: the starting value for the first class and the class width.

To manually find the class width, calculate the following and then round up to a nice number.

$\text{class width}=\frac{\text{maximum value - minimum value}}{\text{number of classes}}$

After you have determined the class width, choose a starting value that is the minimum value in the data or lower than the minimum value.

## Creating a Grouped Frequency Distribution with Specified Number of Classes

Use the [class_survey1]{.data} to create a grouped frequency distribution with 6 classes for the distance a student lives from the Lone Tree Campus of Coconino Community College.

![Rguroo dataset logo](Rguroo_Icons/Rguroo_repo_logo.png) The dataset for this example is available in the Rguroo dataset repository [Kozak]{.repo}, with the dataset name [class_survey1]{.data}. A complete description of the variables is provided in the [dataset code book](#code-book-class).
:::

**Solution**

To create a grouped frequency distribution with 6 classes, we need to calculate the class width. For this variable the maximum value is 50 and the minimum value is 0.6.  Use these values in the class width formula to find the class width. 

$\text{class width}=\frac{50-0.6}{6}=8.233$

Next, we round the class width up to a nice number, such as class width = 10.  Now we need a starting value.  Since the minimum value was 0.6, we can use 0 as the starting value just as we did in the last grouped frequency distribution. Enter the information in the Binning dialog box as shown in the image below.

```{r,echo=FALSE}

### Graphical Displays of Quantitative Data

There are several different graphical displays for quantitative data. With quantitative data, you can talk about how the data is distributed, called a distribution. In addition, the shape of the distribution can be described from the graphs.

**Histogram:** A graph of frequencies (counts) on the vertical axis and classes on the horizontal axis. The height of the rectangles is the frequency (or relative frequency) and the width of the rectangle is called the class width. The width depends on how many values (bins) are in the histogram. 

**Density Plot:** Similar to a histogram, except smoothing is created to smooth out the graph. The shape is not dependent on the number of bins so the distribution is easier to determine from the density plot.

**Stem and Leaf Plot:** A graph that organizes numerical data by splitting each value into a "stem" (leading digit(s)) and a "leaf" (the last digit) to show data distribution, frequency, and shape.

@fig-class_data_density is a density plot showing the overlay of the smooth density curve. Notice the histogram and density plot are very similar, but the density plot is smoother. Both the histogram and density plot give you similar insights about the shape of the distribution; however, the smooth density curve highlights the underlying shape of the distribution by smoothing out the jaggedness of the histogram. Reviewing the graphs you can see that most of the students live within 15 miles of the Lone Tree Campus, in fact most live within 5 miles from the campus. However, there is a student who lives around 50 miles from the Lone Tree Campus. This is a great deal farther from the rest of the data. This value could be considered an outlier.

An **outlier** is a data value that is far from the rest of the values. It may be an unusual value or a mistake. It is a data value that should be investigated. In this case, the student lived really far from campus, thus the value is not a mistake, and is just very unusual.


### Shapes of the distribution:

When you look at a distribution, look at the basic shape. There are some basic shapes that are seen in histograms. Realize though that some distributions have no shape. The common shapes are bell-shape, skewed (right or left), and uniform. Another interest is how many peaks a graph may have. This is known as modal.

Modal refers to the number of peaks. A unimodal distribution has one peak, and a bimodal distribution has two peaks. Usually, if a graph has more than two peaks, it suggests that the data come from multiple groups with different characteristics related to the measured variable.

Examining the shape of a distribution gives you a deeper understanding of how your data behaves beyond simple averages or totals. The shape reveals patterns, such as whether values cluster tightly, spread out widely, lean to one side, or form multiple peaks. These aspect that can influence how you interpret results. By paying attention to features like symmetry, skewness, and unusual gaps or spikes, you gain insight into underlying trends, potential outliers, and the most appropriate statistical methods to use.

Other important features to consider are how spread out is the data, and where the center of the graph is. These concepts will be explored in Chapter 3.

### Examples of graphs:

**Bell-Shape**

This graph is bell-shape:
```{r,echo=FALSE}
#| fig-alt: "See the description of the graph below the graph"
#| warning: FALSE
#| label: fig-bell_shape
#| fig-cap: "Bell Shape Graph"
#| out.width: "80%"
knitr::include_graphics(
  "Rguroo_outputs/Graphical_Description_of_Data/symmetric.png"
)
```


@fig-bell_shape is a bell-shaped histogram.  Bell shaped graphs have a balanced, mirror‑like appearance, with the bars rising to a peak near the center and then decreasing at roughly the same rate on both sides. The left and right halves of the distribution look similar in both height and spread, so if you folded the graph down the middle, the two sides would line up closely. There are no long tails pulling the shape in one direction, and the overall pattern often forms a smooth, mound‑shaped curve. Note that bell-shape doesn’t require perfect symmetry.

**Bimodal**

This graph is bimodal:

```{r,echo=FALSE}
#| fig-alt: "See the description of the graph below the graph"
#| warning: FALSE
#| label: fig-bimodal
#| fig-cap: "Bimodal Graph"
#| out.width: "80%"
knitr::include_graphics(
  "Rguroo_outputs/Graphical_Description_of_Data/bimodal_symmetric.png"
)
```


@fig-bimodal is a bimodal histogram which has two distinct peaks, meaning the bars rise to form one cluster of high values, dip down in the middle, and then rise again to form a second cluster.  Visually, the histogram looks like a pair of hills or humps separated by a noticeable valley. In this histogram, the overall shape is symmetric; however, this is not a requirement for a bimodal graph. In addition, the separation between the peaks can be sharp or gradual.

**Skewed Right**

This graph is skewed to the right:

```{r,echo=FALSE}
#| fig-alt: "See the description of the graph below the graph"
#| warning: FALSE
#| label: fig-skewed_right
#| fig-cap: "Skewed Right Graph"
#| out.width: "80%"
knitr::include_graphics(
  "Rguroo_outputs/Graphical_Description_of_Data/skewed_right.png"
)
```


@fig-skewed_right is a skewed right histogram that has most of its highest bars on the left side, with the heights tapering off gradually as you move to the right. The bulk of the data forms a tall block on the left, while a long, stretched‑out tail extends as you move right. The most frequently occurring data sits closer to the left, and the right tail is noticeably longer and thinner than the left.

**Skewed Left Distribution**

This graph is skewed to the left:

```{r,echo=FALSE}
#| fig-alt: "See the description of the graph below the graph"
#| warning: FALSE
#| label: fig-skewed_left
#| fig-cap: "Skewed Left Graph"
#| out.width: "80%"
knitr::include_graphics(
  "Rguroo_outputs/Graphical_Description_of_Data/skewed_left2.png"
)
```


@fig-skewed_left is a skewed left histogram that has most of its highest bars on the right side, with the heights tapering off gradually as you move to the left. The bulk of the data forms a tall block on the right, while a long, stretched‑out tail extends as you move left.The most frequently occurring data sits closer to the right, and the left tail is noticeably longer and thinner than the left.

**Uniform Distribution**

This graph is uniform:

```{r,echo=FALSE}
#| fig-alt: "See the description of the graph below the graph"
#| warning: FALSE
#| label: fig-uniform
#| fig-cap: "Uniform Graph"
#| out.width: "80%"
knitr::include_graphics(
  "Rguroo_outputs/Graphical_Description_of_Data/uniform.png"
)
```


@fig-uniform is a uniform histogram that has bars that are all roughly the same height, giving the graph a flat, even appearance across the entire range of values. No single interval stands out as especially common or rare; instead, the data are spread evenly, with each bar occurring at about the same frequency. Visually, it looks like a row of nearly level rectangles, without peaks, clusters, or noticeable patterns. Note that the graph above is perfectly uniform (all heights of the bars are equal); however, this is not a requirement to be uniform.

**Solution**

**Before you begin:** Make sure you have already imported the [tuition_4_year]{.data} dataset into your Rguroo account, as was shown [here](#Importing-Data-to-Rguroo-Chapter-2).

To create create a density plot, follow the directions for creating a histogram [here](#Creating-Histogram-of-Distance-in-Rguroo). For this example, you will select the [tuition_4_year]{.data} dataset from the [Dataset]{.dpd} dropdown, and choose the [INSTATE_TUITION]{.var} variable from the [Variable]{.dpd} dropdown.  Since this is a density plot, remember to select "density" in both the Type and Smoothing boxes. Also, rememeber to label your graph appropriately. An image of the dialog box is shown below.

```

@fig-density_instate_tuition is a density plot of instate tuition that has the highest peak on left, then a dip and up to a smaller peak in the middle that is lower than the left peak. Then the bar heights gradually decrease as you move to the right. Due to the characteristics of the graph, the distribution is skewed right.

To create a density plot of instate tuition by type, go to the Basics tab and open your Histogram dialog box. Leave everything you have for creating the density plot. In the "Plot by Group" box, choose the [TYPE]{.var} variable from the [Factor]{.dpd} dropdown. An image of the dialog box is shown below.

@fig-tuition_data_density_type shows density plots for instate tuition, separated by for‑profit, private nonprofit, and public 4‑year colleges.  The [for_profit_4_year]{.var} plot has the highest peak on left, the [private_4_year]{.var} plot has the highest peak in the middle, and the [public_4_year]{.var} plot has the highest peak on the left. Public 4 year has the highest peak, with for profit 4 year is lower, and then private 4 year with the lowest peak Because these are density plots, the height of each curve reflects how concentrated the data are in different tuition ranges, and the shape reveals where most institutions fall.

The density plots reveal distinct tuition patterns across the three types of 4‑year institutions. Public colleges have the lowest in‑state tuition, with most schools clustering around $10,000 and relatively little variation, indicating that public tuition is both affordable and fairly consistent nationwide. For‑profit colleges fall in the middle, with tuition centered near $20,000 and a moderately narrow spread, suggesting that many of these institutions charge similar amounts, though a few are more expensive. Private nonprofit colleges stand out as the most costly group, with a peak around $35,000 and a wide distribution that stretches toward much higher tuition levels. This broad spread shows that private colleges vary substantially in price, with some moderately priced and others extremely expensive. Looking at the density curves by type of institution makes it clear that public colleges are the most affordable, for‑profit colleges occupy a middle ground, and private nonprofit colleges are the most expensive and most variable in their tuition levels.

Boxplots are another type of visual display for quantitative data that allows for comparison of two groups.  However, boxplots require a few simple calculations, so they will be explored in the next section.

## Other Graphical Representations of Data

There are many other types of graphs. Some of the more common ones are the point plot (scatter plot), and a time-series plot. There are also many different graphs that have emerged lately for qualitative data. Many are found in publications and websites. The following is a description of the point plot (scatter plot), and the time-series plot.

### Point Plots or Scatter Plot

Sometimes you have two different variables and you want to see if they are related in any way. A scatter plot helps you to see what the relationship would look like. A scatter plot displays the ordered pairs on the cartesian coordinate system (x-y axis).

::: {#exm-scatter-plot}
## Creating a Scatter Plot

Data was collected from a simulation study about motorcycle accidents used to test crash helmets.The study recorded the head acceleration after impact.  Is there a relationship between head acceleration and time after impact? 

![Rguroo dataset logo](Rguroo_Icons/Rguroo_repo_logo.png) The dataset for this example is available in the Rguroo dataset repository [MASS]{.repo}, with the dataset name [mcycle]{.data}. @tbl-Tuition displays the first five rows of the dataset. A complete description of the variables is provided in the [dataset code book](#code-book-mcycle) that follows.

**Solution**

To answer this question, we can examine the data on a scatterplot and look for patterns. 

Preliminary: State the explanatory variable and the response variable

Let:

$x$=explanatory variable = time after impact (in ms)

$y$=response variable = head acceleration (in g)

**Before you begin:** Make sure you have already imported the [mcycle]{.data} dataset into your Rguroo account, as was shown [here](#Importing-Data-to-Rguroo-Chapter-2). This dataset is in the repository MASS.

1. Open the **Plots** toolbox in Rguroo.  
2. Open the [Create Plot]{.dpd} dropdown, and select [Scatter Plot]{.fun}. This opens the Scatter Plot dialog.  
3. In the Scatter Plot dialog, choose the [mcycle]{.data} dataset from the [Dataset]{.dpd} dropdown.  
4. Choose the [times]{.var} variable from the [Predictor (x)]{.dpd} dropdown. 
5. Choose the [accel]{.var} variable from the [Response (y)]{.dpd} dropdown.
6. **(Optional)** In the **Label** section of the dialog:  
   - Enter [Scatterplot of Head Acceleration vs. Time After Impact]{.typein} in the [Title]{.des} textbox.  
   - Enter [Time After Impact (milliseconds)]{.typein} in the [X-Axis]{.des} textbox.  
   - Enter [Head Acceleration (g)]{.typein} in the [Y-Axis]{.des} textbox.

knitr::include_graphics(

)
```

@fig-mcycle shows how head acceleration changes after an impact. At first, the acceleration stays close to zero, meaning the head hasn’t begun to move yet. Around 20 milliseconds, there is a sudden and dramatic drop to about –120 g, indicating a rapid backward motion caused by the initial force of the impact. Immediately afterward, the acceleration rebounds sharply upward to more than +60 g, showing the head snapping forward. Following this, the acceleration values fluctuate between negative and positive g's, but gradually settle toward zero. This suggests that the head’s motion is slowing down and returning to a stable state. Overall, the pattern reflects a typical impact response: an initial delay, a strong backward acceleration, a forward rebound, and then diminishing movement over time. Although this scatterplot shows a relationship between time after impact and head acceleration, the pattern does not follow a simple linear shape.

### **Time-Series**

A time-series plot is a graph showing the data measurements in chronological order, the data being quantitative data. For example, a time-series plot is used to show profits over the last 5 years.

The purpose of a time-series graph is to look for trends over time. Caution, you must realize that the trend may not continue. Just because you see an increase, doesn't mean the increase will continue forever. As an example, prior to 2007, many people noticed that housing prices were increasing. The belief at the time was that housing prices would continue to increase. However, the housing bubble burst in 2007, and many houses lost value, and haven't recovered.

4.  The World Bank collected data on the percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) that a country spends on health expenditures (Current health expenditure (% of GDP), 2019), the fertility rate of the country (Fertility rate, total (births per woman), 2019), and the percentage of women receiving prenatal care (Pregnant women receiving prenatal care (%), 2019). The first 6 rows for the dataset containing the countries where this information is available in @tbl-Fert_prenatal. Create a scatter plot of the health expenditure and percentage of women receiving prenatal care in the year 2000, and state if there appears to be a relationship between percentage spent on health expenditure and the percentage of women receiving prenatal care.
