Chapter 8 discussed methods of estimating population parameters from one sample using confidence intervals. This chapter will look at methods of confidence intervals and hypothesis testing for two populations. Since there are two populations, there are two random variables, two means or proportions, and two samples (though with paired samples you usually consider there to be one sample with pairs collected). Examples of where you would do this are:\n\nTesting and estimating the difference in testosterone levels of men before and after they had children (Gettler, McDade, Feranil & Kuzawa, 2011).\n\nTesting the claim that a diet works by looking at the weight before and after subjects are on the diet.\n\nEstimating the difference in proportion of those who approve of President Obama in the age group 18 to 26 year old and the 55 and over age group.\n\nAll of these are examples of hypothesis tests or confidence intervals for two populations. The methods to conduct these hypothesis tests and confidence intervals will be explored in this chapter. As a reminder, all hypothesis tests are the same process. The only thing that changes is the formula that you use and the conditions. Confidence intervals are also the same process, except that the formula is different.\n\n\nThere are times you want to test a claim about two population proportions or construct a confidence interval estimate of the difference between two population proportions. As with all other hypothesis tests and confidence intervals, the process is the same though the formulas and conditions are different.\n\n### Hypothesis Test for Two Population Proportion (2-Prop Test)\n\n1.  State the random variables and the parameters in words.\n\n$x_1$ = number of successes from group 1\n\n$x_2$ = number of successes from group 2\n\n$p_1$ = proportion of successes in group 1\n\n$p_2$ = proportion of successes in group 2\n\n2.  State the null and alternative hypotheses and the level of significance\n\n$H_o:p_1=p_2$\n\n$H_a: p_1\\ne p_2$. the $\\ne$ can be replaced with $<$ or $>$ depending on the question.\n\nAlso, state your $\\alpha$ level here.\n\n3.  State and check the conditions for a hypothesis test\n\n<!-- -->\n\na.  State: A simple random sample of size $n_1$ is taken from population 1, and a simple random sample of size $n_2$ is taken from population 2. Check: describe how each sample was collected.\n\nb.  State: The samples are independent. Check: describe why the two samples are independent.\n\nc.  State: The properties for the binomial distribution are satisfied for both populations. Check: describe how each population meets all the properties.\n\nd.  State: The sampling distribution of $\\hat{p_1}$ can be approximated as a normal distribution. Check: To determine the sampling distribution of $\\hat{p_1}$, you need to show that $p_1*n_1\\ge5$ and $q_1*n_1\\ge5$ where $q_1=1-p_1$. If this requirement is true, then the sampling distribution of $\\hat{p_1}$ is well approximated by a normal curve. State: The sampling distribution of $\\hat{p_2}$ can be approximated as a normal distribution. Check: To determine the sampling distribution of $\\hat{p_2}$, you need to show that $p_2*n_2\\ge 5$ and $q_2*n_2\\ge 5$ where $q_2=1-p_2$. If this requirement is true, then the sampling distribution of $\\hat{p_2}$ is well approximated by a normal curve. However, if you do not know $p_1$ and $p_2$, you will need to use $\\hat{p_1}$ and $\\hat{p_2}$ instead. This is not perfect, but it is the best you can do.\n\n<!-- -->\n\n4.  Find the sample statistics, test statistic, and p-value\n\nOn rStudio, use the command\n\nprop.test(c(x1,x2), c(n1, n2)\n\n5.  Conclusion\n\nThis is where you write reject or fail to reject $H_o$. The rule is: if the p-value $<\\alpha$, then reject $H_o$. If the p-value $\\ge \\alpha$, then fail to reject $H_o$.\n\n6.  Interpretation\n\nThis is where you interpret in real world terms the conclusion to the test. The conclusion for a hypothesis test is that you either have enough evidence to support $H_a$, or you do not have enough evidence to support $H_a$.\n\n### Confidence Interval for the Difference Between Two Population Proportion (2-Prop Interval)\n\nThe confidence interval for the difference in proportions has the same random variables and proportions and the same conditions as the hypothesis test for two proportions. If you have already completed the hypothesis test, then you do not need to state them again. If you haven't completed the hypothesis test, then state the random variables and proportions and state and check the conditions before completing the confidence interval step.\n\n1.  Find the sample statistics and the confidence interval\n\nThe confidence interval estimate of the difference is found using the following command in r Studio:\n\nprop.test(c(x1,x2), c(n1, n2), conf.level=C) Type C as a decimal\n\n2.  Statistical Interpretation: In general this looks like, \"You are C% confident that the confidence interval contains the true difference in proportions.\"\n\n3.  Real World Interpretation: This is where you state how much more (or less) the first proportion is from the second proportion.\n\n### Example: Hypothesis Test for Two Population Proportions\n\nDo husbands cheat on their wives in a different proportion from the proportion of wives cheat on their husbands (\"Statistics brain,\" 2013)? Suppose you take a group of 1000 randomly selected husbands and find that 231 had cheated on their wives. Suppose in a group of 1200 randomly selected wives, 176 cheated on their husbands. Do the data show that the proportion of husbands who cheat on their wives is different from the proportion of wives who cheat on their husbands. Test at the 5% level.\n\n#### Solution\n\n1.  State the random variables and the parameters in words.\n\n$x_1$ = number of husbands who cheat on his wife\n\n$x_2$ = number of wives who cheat on her husband\n\n$p_1$ = proportion of husbands who cheat on his wife\n\n$p_2$ = proportion of wives who cheat on her husband\n\n2.  State the null and alternative hypotheses and the level of significance\n\n$H_o: p_1=p_2$\n\n$H_a: p_1\\ne p_2$\n\nlevel of significance is $\\alpha=0.05$\n\n3.  State and check the conditions for a hypothesis test\n\n<!-- -->\n\na.  State: A simple random sample of 1000 responses about cheating from husbands is taken. Check: This was stated in the problem. State: A simple random sample of 1200 responses about cheating from wives is taken. Check: This was stated in the problem.\n\nb.  State: The samples are independent. Check: The samples are independent. This is true since the samples involved different genders.\n\nc.  State: The properties of the binomial distribution are satisfied in both populations. Check: This is true since there are only two responses, there are a fixed number of trials, the probability of a success is the same, and the trials are independent.\n\nd.  State: The sampling distributions of $\\hat{p_1}$ and $\\hat{p_2}$ can be approximated with a normal distribution. Check: $n_1*p_1$, $n_2*p_2$, $n_1*q_1$, and $n_2*q_2$ are all greater than or equal to 5. So both sampling distributions of $\\hat{p_1}$ and $\\hat{p_2}$ can be approximated with a normal distribution.\n\n<!-- -->\n\n4.  Find the sample statistics, test statistic, and p-value\n\nOn r use the command:\n\n```{r prop-test9}\nprop.test(c(231,176), c(1000, 1200))\n```\n\n5.  Conclusion\n\nReject $H_o$, since the p-value is less than 5%.\n\n6.  Interpretation\n\nThis is enough evidence to support that the proportion of husbands having affairs is different from the proportion of wives having affairs.\n\n### Example: Confidence Interval for Two Population Proportions\n\nWhat is the difference in proportion that husbands cheat on their wives than wives cheat on the husbands (\"Statistics brain,\" 2013)? Suppose you take a group of 1000 randomly selected husbands and find that 231 had cheated on their wives. Suppose in a group of 1200 randomly selected wives, 176 cheated on their husbands. Estimate the difference in the proportion of husbands and wives who cheat on their spouses using a 95% confidence level.\n\n#### Solution\n\n1.  State the random variables and the parameters in words.\n\nThese were stated in [Example: Hypothesis Test for Two Population Proportions].\n\n2.  State and check the conditions for the confidence interval\n\nThe conditions were stated and checked in [Example: Hypothesis Test for Two Population Proportions].\n\n3.  Find the sample statistics and the confidence interval\n\nOn r use the command:\n\n```{r prop-test9a}\nprop.test(c(231,176), c(1000, 1200), conf.level = .95)\n```\n\n4.  Statistical Interpretation: You are 95% confident that $0.05050705<p_1-p_2<0.11815962$ contains the true difference in proportions.\n\n5.  Real World Interpretation: The proportion of husbands who cheat on their wives is anywhere from 5.05% to 11.82% higher than the proportion of wives who cheat on their husband.\n\n### Homework for Two Proportions Section\n\n**In each problem show all steps of the hypothesis test or confidence interval. If some of the conditions are not met, note that the results of the test or interval may not be correct and then continue the process of the hypothesis test or confidence interval.**\n\n1.  Many high school students take the AP tests in different subject areas. In 2007, of the 144,796 students who took the biology exam 84,199 of them were female. In that same year, of the 211,693 students who took the calculus AB exam 102,598 of them were female (\"AP exam scores,\" 2013). Is there enough evidence to show that the proportion of female students taking the biology exam is different than the proportion of female students taking the calculus AB exam?

Are there more children diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in states that have larger urban areas over states that are mostly rural? In the state of Pennsylvania, a fairly urban state, there are 245 eight year old diagnosed with ASD out of 18,440 eight year old evaluated. In the state of Utah, a fairly rural state, there are 45 eight year old diagnosed with ASD out of 2,123 eight year old evaluated (\"Autism and developmental,\" 2008). Is there enough evidence to show that the proportion of children diagnosed with ASD in Pennsylvania is different than the proportion in Utah? Test at the 1% level.\n\n6.

A child dying from an accidental poisoning is a terrible incident. Is it more likely that a male child will get into poison than a female child? To find this out, data was collected that showed that out of 1830 children between the ages one and four who pass away from poisoning, 1031 were males and 799 were females (Flanagan, Rooney & Griffiths, 2005). Do the data show that there is different proportion of male children dying of poisoning than female children? Test at the 1% level.\n\n8.  A child dying from an accidental poisoning is a terrible incident. Is it more likely that a male child will get into poison than a female child? To find this out, data was collected that showed that out of 1830 children between the ages one and four who pass away from poisoning, 1031 were males and 799 were females (Flanagan, Rooney & Griffiths, 2005). Compute a 99% confidence interval for the difference in proportions of poisoning deaths of male and female children ages one to four.\n\n## Paired Samples for Two Means\n\nAre two populations the same? Is the average height of men taller than the average height of women? Is the mean weight less after a diet than before?\n\nYou can compare populations by comparing their means. You take a sample from each population and compare the statistics.\n\nAnytime you compare two populations you need to know if the samples are independent or dependent. The formulas you use are different for different types of samples.\n\nIf how you choose one sample has no effect on the way you choose the other sample, the two samples are **independent**. The way to think about it is that in independent samples, the observations from one sample are overall different from the observations from the other sample. This will mean that sample one has no affect on sample two. The sample values from one sample are not related or paired with values from the other sample.\n\nIf you choose the samples so that a measurement in one sample is paired with a measurement from the other sample, the samples are **dependent** or **matched** or **paired**. (Often a before and after situation.) You want to make sure the there is a meaning for pairing data values from one sample with a specific data value from the other sample. One way to think about it is that in dependent samples, the observations from one sample are the same observations from the other sample, though there can be other reasons to pair values. This makes the sample values from each sample paired.\n\nIn tidy data, remember each row is a unit of observation, and each column is a variable. In paired samples, you would have two variables that you are working with. In independent samples, you would have a variable that distinguishes an observation from another observation. As an example, in the Pulse data frame, consider the variables pulse_before and pulse_after. Since they are measured off the same observation, then comparing the two variables would be a paired samples analysis. However, consider the pulse_after and whether a person smokes would be comparing the variable pulse_after against the variable smokes to see if smoking effects a person's pulse rate after exercise. In this case, the observations would be different based on smoking yes or smoking no. Consider the variable smoking to be the factor that one is interested in seeing how it effects pulse rate in the data frame @tbl-Pulse.\n\n### Example: Independent or Dependent Samples\n\nDetermine if the following are dependent or independent samples.\n\na.  Randomly choose 5 men and 6 women and compare their heights\nb.  Choose 10 men and weigh them. Give them a new diet drug and later weigh them again.\nc.  Take 10 people and measure the strength of their dominant arm and their non-dominant arm.\n\n#### Solution\n\na.  Randomly choose 5 men and 6 women and compare their heights\n\n    Independent, since there is no reason that one value belongs to another. The units of observations are not the same for both samples. The units of observations are definitely different. A way to think about this is that the knowledge that a man is chosen in one sample does not give any information about any of the woman chosen in the other sample.\n\n<!-- -->\n\nb.  Choose 10 men and weigh them. Give them a new diet drug and later weigh them again.\n\n    Dependent, since each person's before weight can be matched with their after weight. The units of observations are the same for both samples. A way to think about this is that the knowledge that a person weighs 400 pounds at the beginning will tell you something about their weight after the diet drug.\n\nc.  Take 10 people and measure the strength of their dominant arm and their non-dominant arm.\n\n    Dependent, since you can match the two arm strengths. The units of observations are the same for both samples. So the knowledge of one person's dominant arm strength will tell you something about the strength of their non-dominant arm.\n\nTo analyze data when there are matched or paired samples, called dependent samples, you conduct a paired t-test. Since the samples are matched, you can find the difference between the values of the two random variables.\n\n### Hypothesis Test for Two Sample Paired t-Test\n\n1.  State the random variables and the parameters in words.\n\n$x_1$ = random variable 1\n\n$x_2$ = random variable 2\n\n$\\mu_1$ = mean of random variable 1\n\n$\\mu_2$ = mean of random variable 2\n\n2.  State the null and alternative hypotheses and the level of significance\n\nThe hypotheses would be\n\n$H_o:\\mu_1=\\mu_2$ or$H_o:\\mu_1-\\mu_2=0$\n\n$H_a:\\mu_1\\ne \\mu_2$ or $H_a:\\mu_1-\\mu_2\\ne0$\n\nHowever, since you are finding the differences, then you can actually think of $\\mu_1-\\mu_2=\\mu_d$.\n\nSo the hypotheses could become\n\n$H_o:\\mu_d=0$\n\n$H_a:\\mu_d\\ne 0$ Remember, you can replace $\\ne$ with $<$ or $>$.\n\nAlso, state your $\\alpha$ level here.\n\n3.  State and check the conditions for the hypothesis test\n\n<!-- -->\n\na.  State: A random sample of $n$ pairs is taken. Check: state how the sample was collected.\n\nb.  Check: The population of the difference between random variables is normally distributed. Check: In this case the population you are interested in has to do with the differences that you find. It does not matter if each random variable is normally distributed. It is only important if the differences you find are normally distributed. Just as before, the t-test is fairly robust to the condition if the sample size is large. This means that if this condition isn't met, but your sample size is quite large, then the results of the t-test are valid.\n\n<!-- -->\n\n4.  Find the sample statistic, test statistic, and p-value\n\nRealize that a paired test is a one sample t-test on the difference between two variables. So you are running a one-sample t-test on a new variable known as the difference variable. You need to create this difference variable by creating a new data frame. This is done on rStudio by doing the following command (The following shows how to create the variable difference for pulse_after-pulse_before on the data frame Pulse. Change the variables used and data frame used to your data frame and variables):\n\n```{r pulse9-new-data}\n#| tbl-alt: \"Table showing first 6 rows of Pulse dataset with difference column added\"\n#| warning: FALSE\n#| label: tbl-Pulse_Difference\n#| tbl-cap: \"Pulse Data frame with Difference Column Added\"\nPulse<-\n  Pulse |>\n  mutate(difference=pulse_after-pulse_before) \nknitr::kable(head(Pulse))\n```\n\nNotice rStudio added a new variable called difference to the data frame @tbl-Pulse_Difference. Now to conduct a paired t-test use the rStudio command\n\nt.test(\\~difference_variable, data=Data_Frame)\n\nNote: if the $H_a$ is \\<, then the command becomes\n\nt.test(\\~difference_variable, data=Data_Frame, alternative=\"less\")\n\nSimilarly for \\> put alternative=\"greater\"\n\n5.  Conclusion\n\nThis is where you write reject $H_o$ or fail to reject $H_o$. The rule is: if the p-value $<\\alpha$, then reject $H_o$. If the p-value $\\ge\\alpha$, then fail to reject $H_o$.\n\n6.  Interpretation\n\nThis is where you interpret in real world terms the conclusion to the test. The conclusion for a hypothesis test is that you either have enough evidence to support $H_a$, or you do not have enough evidence to support $H_a$.\n\n### Confidence Interval for Difference in Means from Paired Samples (t-Interval)\n\nThe confidence interval for the difference in means has the same random variables and means and the same conditions as the hypothesis test for two paired samples. If you have already completed the hypothesis test, then you do not need to state them again. If you haven't completed the hypothesis test, then state the random variables and means, and state and check the conditions before completing the confidence interval step.\n\n1.  Find the sample statistic and confidence interval. Again, you will need to create a new data frame with a difference variable. Then on rStudio the command is\n\n    t.test(\\~difference_variable, data=Data_Frame, conf.level=C) Type C as a decimal\n\n<!-- -->\n\n2.  Statistical Interpretation: In general this looks like, \"You are C% confident that the statement contains the true mean difference.\"\n\n3.  Real World Interpretation: This is where you state what interval contains the true mean difference.\n\n### Example: Hypothesis Test for Paired Samples\n\nIs the pulse rate after exercise different from the pulse rate before exercise for a woman who drinks alcohol? Use the data frame @tbl-Pulse. Test at the 5% level.\n\n**Code book for data frame Pulse below @tbl-Pulse.**\n\n#### Solution\n\n1.  State the random variables and the parameters in words.\n\n$x_1$ = pulse of a smoking woman who drinks alcohol after exercise\n\n$x_2$ = pulse of a smoking woman who drinks alcohol before exercise\n\n$\\mu_1$ = mean pulse of a smoking woman who drinks alcohol after exercise\n\n$\\mu_2$ = mean pulse of a smoking woman who drinks alcohol after exercise\n\n2.  State the null and alternative hypotheses and the level of significance\n\n$H_o: \\mu_1=\\mu_2$\n\n$H_a: \\mu_1\\ne \\mu_2$\n\nlevel of significance, $\\alpha=0.05$\n\n3.  State and check the conditions for the hypothesis test\n\n<!-- -->\n\na.  State: A random sample of 110 pairs of pulse rates after and before exercise was taken. Check: The data frame says that the data was collected from students in classes for several years. Though this was not a random sample, it is probably a representative sample.\n\nb.  State: The population of the difference in after and before pulse rates is normally distributed. Check: To see if this is true, look at the density plot and the normal quantile plot for the difference between after and before. This variable must be created before the density plot and normal quantile plot can be created. The data frame @tbl-Females is females who drink alcohol.\n\n```{r pulse9-female-data}\n#| tbl-alt: \"Pulse Rates Before and After Exercise of females who do drink alcohol with difference\"\n#| label: tbl-Females\n#| tbl-cap: \"Pulse Rates Before and After Exercise of Females who do drink Alcohol with Difference\"\nPulse_female<- \n  Pulse |> \n  filter(gender==\"female\", alcohol==\"yes\") \nknitr::kable(head(Pulse_female))\n```\n\nNow mutate @tbl-Females data frame to include a difference variable.\n\n```{r pulse9-female-new-data}\n#| tbl-alt: \"Table showing first 6 rows of Female Pulse dataset with difference column added\"\n#| warning: FALSE\n#| label: tbl-Females_difference\n#| tbl-cap: \"Pulse Rates Before and After Exercise of Females who do drink Alcohol with Difference\"\nPulse_female<-\n  Pulse_female |> \n  mutate(difference=pulse_after-pulse_before) \nknitr::kable(head(Pulse_female))\n```\n\nUsing @tbl-Females_difference create a density plot and normal quantile plot on the difference variable.\n\n```{r pulse9-female-density}\n#| fig-alt: \"Density plot of differences in pulse rates. Not symmetric\"\n#| warning: FALSE\n#| label: fig-pulse-female-density\n#| fig-cap: \"Density plot of differences in pulse rates\"\ngf_density(~difference, data=Pulse_female, title = \"Difference in Pulse Rates for Females who drink Alcohol\", xlab=\"Difference Between Before and After\")\n```\n\n```{r pulse9-female-qq}\n#| fig-alt: \"normal qunatile plot plot of differences in pulse rates.

So you cannot assume that the distribution of the difference in pulse rates is normal. It is good that the t-test is robust if there is a large sample. The sample is of size 110, so that should be adequate to assume the conclusion is valid.\n\n4.  Find the sample statistic, test statistic, and p-value On r Studio, use the command:\n\n```{r pulse9-female-new-ttest}\nt.test(~difference, data=Pulse_female)\n```\n\n5.  Conclusion\n\nSince the p-value \\< 0.05, reject $H_o$.\n\n6.  Interpretation\n\nThere is enough evidence to support that there is a difference in pulse rate before and after exercise of females who smoke.\n\n### Example: Hypothesis Test for Paired Samples {#example-hypothesis-test-for-paired-samples-1}\n\nThe New Zealand Air Force purchased a batch of flight helmets. They then found out that the helmets didn't fit. In order to make sure that they order the correct size helmets, they measured the head size of recruits. To save money, they wanted to use cardboard calipers, but were not sure if they will be accurate enough. So they took 18 recruits and measured their heads with the cardboard calipers and also with metal calipers. The data frame is in @tbl-Helmet (Helmet Sizes for New Zealand Airforce, 2019). Do the data provide enough evidence to show that there is a difference in measurements between the cardboard and metal calipers? Use a 5% level of significance.\n\n```{r helmet9-data}\n#| tbl-alt: \"Table showing first 6 rows of Helmet dataset\"\n#| warning: FALSE\n#| label: tbl-Helmet\n#| tbl-cap: \"Helmet Head Measurments\"\nHelmet<-read.csv( \"https://krkozak.github.io/MAT160/helmet.csv\") \nknitr::kable(head(Helmet))\n```\n\n**Code book for data frame Helmet**\n\n**Description** After purchasing a batch of flight helmets that did not fit the heads of many pilots, the NZ Airforce decided to measure the head sizes of all recruits. Before this was carried out, information was collected to determine the feasibility of using cheap cardboard calipers to make the measurements, instead of metal ones which were expensive and uncomfortable. The data lists the head diameters of 18 recruits measured once using cardboard calipers and again using metal calipers. One question is whether there is any systematic difference between the two sets of calipers. One might also ask whether there is more variability in the cardboard calipers measurement than that of the metal calipers.\n\nThis data frame contains the following columns:\n\nCardboard: measurement using cardboard calipers (cm)\n\nMetal: measurement using metal calipers (cm)\n\nSource Helmet Sizes for New Zealand Airforce.

Check: First create the difference variable, then the density plot and normal quantile plot.\n\n```{r helmet9a-data}\n#| tbl-alt: \"Table showing first 6 rows of Helmet dataset with difference column added\"\n#| warning: FALSE\n#| label: tbl-Helmet-difference\n#| tbl-cap: \"Helmet Head Measurments\"\nHelmet<-\n  Helmet |> \n  mutate(difference=Cardboard-Metal) \nknitr::kable(head(Helmet))\n```\n\n```{r helmet9-new-denstiy}\n#| fig.alt: \"Density plot of differences in head measurements, somewhat bell shaped\"\n#| warning: FALSE\n#| label: fig-helmet-density\n#| fig-cap: \"Density plot of differences in head measurements\"\ngf_density(~difference, data=Helmet, title=\"Differences in Head Measurements\", xlab=\"Difference Between Cardboard and Metal\") \n```\n\n```{r helmet9-new-qq}\n#| fig.alt: \"Normal quantile plot of differences in head measurements, somewhat linear\"\n#| warning: FALSE\n#| label: fig-helmet-qq\n#| fig-cap: \"Normal Quantile Plot of Differences in Head Measurements\"\ngf_qq(~difference, data=Helmet, title=\"Differences in Head Measurements\") \n```\n\nThis density plot @fig-helmet-density looks somewhat bell shaped. The normal quantile plot @fig-helmet-qq on the differences looks somewhat linear. So you can assume that the distribution of the difference in weights is normal.\n\n4.  Find the sample statistic, test statistic, and p-value\n\nUsing rStudio the command is\n\n```{r helmet9-ttest}\nt.test(~difference, data=Helmet)\n```\n\nThe sample statistic is 1.6111, the test statistic is 3.1854, and the p-value is 0.005415.\n\n5.  Conclusion\n\nSince the p-value $<$ 0.05, reject $H_o$.\n\n6.  Interpretation\n\nThere is enough evidence to support that the mean head measurements using the cardboard calipers are not the same as when using the metal calipers. So it looks like the New Zealand Air Force shouldn't use the cardboard calipers.\n\n### Example: Confidence Interval for Paired Samples\n\nThe New Zealand Air Force purchased a batch of flight helmets. They then found out that the helmets didn't fit. In order to make sure that they order the correct size helmets, they measured the head size of recruits. To save money, they wanted to use cardboard calipers, but were not sure if they will be accurate enough. So they took 18 recruits and measured their heads with the cardboard calipers and also with metal calipers. The data frame is in @tbl-Helmet (Helmet Sizes for New Zealand Airforce, 2019). Estimate the difference in measurements between the cardboard and metal calipers using a 95% confidence interval.\n\n#### Solution\n\n1.  State the random variables and the parameters in words.\n\nThese were stated in [Example: Hypothesis Test for Paired Samples](#example-hypothesis-test-for-paired-samples-1).\n\n2.  State and check the conditions for the confidence interval\n\nThe conditions were stated and checked in [Example: Hypothesis Test for Paired Samples](#example-hypothesis-test-for-paired-samples-1).\n\n3.  Find the sample statistic and confidence interval\n\nUsing the data frame @tbl-Helmet-difference the rStudio the command is\n\n```{r helmet9-confinterval}\nt.test(~difference, data=Helmet, conf.leve=0.95)\n```\n\n4.  Statistical Interpretation: You are 95% confidence that $0.5440163<\\mu_1-\\mu_2<2.6782060$ contains the true mean difference in head measurement between using the cardboard and metal calibers.\n\n5.  Real World Interpretation: The mean head measurement using the cardboard calibers is anywhere from 0.54 cm to 2.68 cm more than the head measurement using the metal calibers.\n\nExamples 9.2.6 and 9.2.7 use the same data set, but one is conducting a hypothesis test and the other is conducting a confidence interval. Notice that the hypothesis test's conclusion was to reject and say that there was a difference in the means, and the confidence interval does not contain the number 0. If the confidence interval did contain the number 0, then that would mean that the two means could be the same. Since the interval did not contain 0, then you could say that the means are different just as in the hypothesis test. This means that the hypothesis test and the confidence interval can produce the same interpretation. Do be careful though, you can run a hypothesis test with a particular significance level and a confidence interval with a confidence level that is not compatible with your significance level. This will mean that the conclusion from the confidence interval would not be the same as with a hypothesis test. So if you want to estimate the mean difference, then conduct a confidence interval. If you want to show that the means are different, then conduct a hypothesis test. As a reminder, the American Statistical Association (ASA) suggests not conducting hypothesis tests and just create confidence intervals.\n\n### Homework for Paired Samples for Two Means Section\n\n**In each problem show all steps of the hypothesis test or confidence interval.

As with all other hypothesis tests and confidence intervals, the process is the same though the formulas and conditions are different.\n\n### Hypothesis Test for the Difference in Means from Two Independent Samples\n\n1.  State the random variables and the parameters in words.\n\n$x_1$ = random variable 1\n\n$x_2$= random variable 2\n\n$\\mu_1$= mean of random variable 1\n\n$\\mu_2$= mean of random variable 2\n\n2.  State the null and alternative hypotheses and the level of significance\n\nThe hypotheses would be\n\n$H_o:\\mu_1=\\mu_2$\n\n$H_a:\\mu_1\\ne \\mu_2$, the $\\ne$ can be replaced with $<$ or $>$\n\nAlso, state your $\\alpha$ level here.\n\n3.  State and check the conditions for the hypothesis test\n\n<!-- -->\n\na.  State: A random sample of size $n_1$ is taken from population 1. A random sample of size $n_2$ is taken from population 2. Check: describe how both samples are collected. Note: the samples do not need to be the same size, but the test is more robust if they are.\n\nb.  State: The two samples are independent. Check: describe whey the samples are independent of each other.\n\nc.  State: Population 1 is normally distributed. Population 2 is normally distributed. Check: draw the density graph and normal quantile plot for both samples and discuss if they meet the criteria. Just as before, the t-test is fairly robust to the condition if the sample size is large. This means that if this condition isn't met, but your sample sizes are quite large, then the results of the t-test are valid.\n\nd.  State: The population variances are unknown and not assumed to be equal. The old condition is that the variances are equal. However, this condition is no longer a condition that most statisticians use. This is because it isn't really realistic to assume that the variances are equal. So just assume the condition of the variances being unknown and not assumed to be equal is true, and it will not be checked.\n\n<!-- -->\n\n4.  Find the sample statistic, test statistic, and p-value\n\nThe command using r is\n\nt.test(variable\\~factor, data=Data_Frame)\n\nNote: if the $H_a$ is \\<, then the command becomes\n\nt.test(variable\\~factor, data=Data_Frame, alternative=\"less\")\n\nSimilarly for \\> put alternative=\"greater\"\n\n5.  Conclusion\n\nThis is where you write reject or fail to reject $H_0$. The rule is: if the p-value $<\\alpha$, then reject $H_o$. If the p-value $\\ge \\alpha$, then fail to reject $H_o$.\n\n6.  Interpretation\n\nThis is where you interpret in real world terms the conclusion to the test. The conclusion for a hypothesis test is that you either have enough evidence to support $H_a$, or you do not have enough evidence to support $H_a$.\n\n### Confidence Interval for the Difference in Means from Two Independent Samples\n\nThe confidence interval for the difference in means has the same random variables and means and the same conditions as the hypothesis test for independent samples. If you have already completed the hypothesis test, then you do not need to state them again. If you haven't completed the hypothesis test, then state the random variables and means and state and check the conditions before completing the confidence interval step.\n\nFind the sample statistic and confidence interval\n\nOn r Studio, the command is\n\nt.test(variable\\~factor, data=Data_Frame, conf.level=C) type C as a decimal\n\n2.  Statistical Interpretation: In general this looks like, \"You are C% confident that the interval contains the true mean difference.\"\n\n3.  Real World Interpretation: This is where you state what interval contains the true difference in means, though often you state how much more (or less) the first mean is from the second mean.\n\n### Example: Hypothesis Test for Two Means\n\nThe cholesterol level of people vary for many reasons.

State and check the conditions for the hypothesis test\n\n<!-- -->\n\na.  State: A random sample of cholesterol levels of people with diabetes is taken. A random sample of cholesterol levels of people without diabetes is taken.\n\n    Check: The NHANES data frame uses cluster sampling which incorporates random sampling, so the sample is probably representative. This condition has been met.\n\nb.  State: The two samples are independent.\n\n    Check: This is because either they were dealing with people who have diabetes or not.\n\nc.

Using r Studio the command would be\n\n```{r NHANES9b-ttest}\nt.test(TotChol~Diabetes, data=NHANES) \n```\n\n5.  Conclusion\n\nReject $H_o$ since the p-value $<\\alpha$.\n\n6.  Interpretation\n\nThere is enough evidence to support that people who have diabetes have different cholesterol levels on average from people who do not have diabetes.\n\n### Example: Confidence Interval in Two Samples\n\nThe cholesterol level of people vary for many reasons. The question is how different is the cholesterol levels of people with diabetes from people who do not have diabetes? Use the NHANES data frame.

Statistical Interpretation: You are 95% confident that the interval $0.02105115<\\mu_1-\\mu_2<0.19851114$ contains the true difference in means.\n\n5.

To help you to figure out the analysis to conduct, there are a series of questions you should ask yourself.\n\n1.  Does the problem deal with mean or proportion?\n\nSometimes the problem states explicitly the words mean or proportion, but other times you have to figure it out based on the information you are given. If you counted number of individuals that responded in the affirmative to a question, then you are dealing with proportion. If you measured something, then you are dealing with mean.\n\n2.  Does the problem have one or two samples?\n\nSo look to see if one group was measured or if two groups were measured. You need to decide if the problem describes collecting data from one group or from two groups, or if you are comparing two different groups.\n\n3.  If you have two samples, then you need to determine if the samples are independent or dependent.\n\nIf the individuals are different for both samples, then most likely the samples are independent. If you can't tell, then determine if a data value from the first sample influences the data value in the second sample. In other words, can you pair data values together so you can find the difference, and that difference has meaning. If the answer is yes, then the samples are paired. Otherwise, the samples are independent.\n\n4.  Does the situation involve a hypothesis test or a confidence interval?\n\nIf the problem talks about \"do the data show\", \"is there evidence of\", \"test to see\", then you are doing a hypothesis test. If the problem talks about \"find the value\", \"estimate the\" or \"find the interval\", then you are doing a confidence interval.\n\nSo if you have a situation that has two samples, independent samples, involving the mean, and is a hypothesis test, then you have a two-sample independent t-test. Now you look up the conditions and the technology process for doing this test. Every hypothesis test involves the same six steps, and you just have to use the correct conditions and calculations. Every confidence interval has the same five steps, and again you just need to use the correct conditions and calculations. So this is why it is so important to figure out what analysis you should conduct.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n```{r setup9, include=FALSE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\nlibrary(\"tidyverse\")\nlibrary(\"mosaic\") \nlibrary(\"NHANES\") \nPulse<-read.csv( \"https://krkozak.github.io/MAT160/pulse.csv\") \nPulse_female<- \n  Pulse |> \n  filter(gender==\"female\", alcohol==\"yes\")\nReiki<- read.csv( \"https://krkozak.github.io/MAT160/reki.csv\") \nTraffic <- read.csv( \"https://krkozak.github.io/MAT160/traffic.csv\") \n```\n\nChapter 7 discussed methods of hypothesis testing about one-population parameters. Chapter 8 discussed methods of estimating population parameters from one sample using confidence intervals. This chapter will look at methods of confidence intervals and hypothesis testing for two populations. Since there are two populations, there are two random variables, two means or proportions, and two samples (though with paired samples you usually consider there to be one sample with pairs collected). Examples of where you would do this are:\n\nTesting and estimating the difference in testosterone levels of men before and after they had children (Gettler, McDade, Feranil & Kuzawa, 2011).\n\nTesting the claim that a diet works by looking at the weight before and after subjects are on the diet.\n\nEstimating the difference in proportion of those who approve of President Obama in the age group 18 to 26 year old and the 55 and over age group.\n\nAll of these are examples of hypothesis tests or confidence intervals for two populations. The methods to conduct these hypothesis tests and confidence intervals will be explored in this chapter. As a reminder, all hypothesis tests are the same process. The only thing that changes is the formula that you use and the conditions. Confidence intervals are also the same process, except that the formula is different.\n\n## Two Proportions\n\nThere are times you want to test a claim about two population proportions or construct a confidence interval estimate of the difference between two population proportions. As with all other hypothesis tests and confidence intervals, the process is the same though the formulas and conditions are different.\n\n### Hypothesis Test for Two Population Proportion (2-Prop Test)\n\n1.  State the random variables and the parameters in words.\n\n$x_1$ = number of successes from group 1\n\n$x_2$ = number of successes from group 2\n\n$p_1$ = proportion of successes in group 1\n\n$p_2$ = proportion of successes in group 2\n\n2.  State the null and alternative hypotheses and the level of significance\n\n$H_o:p_1=p_2$\n\n$H_a: p_1\\ne p_2$. the $\\ne$ can be replaced with $<$ or $>$ depending on the question.\n\nAlso, state your $\\alpha$ level here.\n\n3.  State and check the conditions for a hypothesis test\n\n<!-- -->\n\na.  State: A simple random sample of size $n_1$ is taken from population 1, and a simple random sample of size $n_2$ is taken from population 2. Check: describe how each sample was collected.\n\nb.  State: The samples are independent. Check: describe why the two samples are independent.\n\nc.  State: The properties for the binomial distribution are satisfied for both populations. Check: describe how each population meets all the properties.\n\nd.  State: The sampling distribution of $\\hat{p_1}$ can be approximated as a normal distribution. Check: To determine the sampling distribution of $\\hat{p_1}$, you need to show that $p_1*n_1\\ge5$ and $q_1*n_1\\ge5$ where $q_1=1-p_1$. If this requirement is true, then the sampling distribution of $\\hat{p_1}$ is well approximated by a normal curve. State: The sampling distribution of $\\hat{p_2}$ can be approximated as a normal distribution. Check: To determine the sampling distribution of $\\hat{p_2}$, you need to show that $p_2*n_2\\ge 5$ and $q_2*n_2\\ge 5$ where $q_2=1-p_2$. If this requirement is true, then the sampling distribution of $\\hat{p_2}$ is well approximated by a normal curve. However, if you do not know $p_1$ and $p_2$, you will need to use $\\hat{p_1}$ and $\\hat{p_2}$ instead. This is not perfect, but it is the best you can do.\n\n<!-- -->\n\n4.  Find the sample statistics, test statistic, and p-value\n\nOn rStudio, use the command\n\nprop.test(c(x1,x2), c(n1, n2)\n\n5.  Conclusion\n\nThis is where you write reject or fail to reject $H_o$. The rule is: if the p-value $<\\alpha$, then reject $H_o$. If the p-value $\\ge \\alpha$, then fail to reject $H_o$.\n\n6.  Interpretation\n\nThis is where you interpret in real world terms the conclusion to the test. The conclusion for a hypothesis test is that you either have enough evidence to support $H_a$, or you do not have enough evidence to support $H_a$.\n\n### Confidence Interval for the Difference Between Two Population Proportion (2-Prop Interval)\n\nThe confidence interval for the difference in proportions has the same random variables and proportions and the same conditions as the hypothesis test for two proportions. If you have already completed the hypothesis test, then you do not need to state them again. If you haven't completed the hypothesis test, then state the random variables and proportions and state and check the conditions before completing the confidence interval step.\n\n1.  Find the sample statistics and the confidence interval\n\nThe confidence interval estimate of the difference is found using the following command in r Studio:\n\nprop.test(c(x1,x2), c(n1, n2), conf.level=C) Type C as a decimal\n\n2.  Statistical Interpretation: In general this looks like, \"You are C% confident that the confidence interval contains the true difference in proportions.\"\n\n3.  Real World Interpretation: This is where you state how much more (or less) the first proportion is from the second proportion.\n\n### Example: Hypothesis Test for Two Population Proportions\n\nDo husbands cheat on their wives in a different proportion from the proportion of wives cheat on their husbands (\"Statistics brain,\" 2013)? Suppose you take a group of 1000 randomly selected husbands and find that 231 had cheated on their wives. Suppose in a group of 1200 randomly selected wives, 176 cheated on their husbands. Do the data show that the proportion of husbands who cheat on their wives is different from the proportion of wives who cheat on their husbands. Test at the 5% level.\n\n#### Solution\n\n1.  State the random variables and the parameters in words.\n\n$x_1$ = number of husbands who cheat on his wife\n\n$x_2$ = number of wives who cheat on her husband\n\n$p_1$ = proportion of husbands who cheat on his wife\n\n$p_2$ = proportion of wives who cheat on her husband\n\n2.  State the null and alternative hypotheses and the level of significance\n\n$H_o: p_1=p_2$\n\n$H_a: p_1\\ne p_2$\n\nlevel of significance is $\\alpha=0.05$\n\n3.  State and check the conditions for a hypothesis test\n\n<!-- -->\n\na.  State: A simple random sample of 1000 responses about cheating from husbands is taken. Check: This was stated in the problem. State: A simple random sample of 1200 responses about cheating from wives is taken. Check: This was stated in the problem.\n\nb.  State: The samples are independent. Check: The samples are independent. This is true since the samples involved different genders.\n\nc.  State: The properties of the binomial distribution are satisfied in both populations. Check: This is true since there are only two responses, there are a fixed number of trials, the probability of a success is the same, and the trials are independent.\n\nd.  State: The sampling distributions of $\\hat{p_1}$ and $\\hat{p_2}$ can be approximated with a normal distribution. Check: $n_1*p_1$, $n_2*p_2$, $n_1*q_1$, and $n_2*q_2$ are all greater than or equal to 5. So both sampling distributions of $\\hat{p_1}$ and $\\hat{p_2}$ can be approximated with a normal distribution.\n\n<!-- -->\n\n4.  Find the sample statistics, test statistic, and p-value\n\nOn r use the command:\n\n```{r prop-test9}\nprop.test(c(231,176), c(1000, 1200))\n```\n\n5.  Conclusion\n\nReject $H_o$, since the p-value is less than 5%.\n\n6.  Interpretation\n\nThis is enough evidence to support that the proportion of husbands having affairs is different from the proportion of wives having affairs.\n\n### Example: Confidence Interval for Two Population Proportions\n\nWhat is the difference in proportion that husbands cheat on their wives than wives cheat on the husbands (\"Statistics brain,\" 2013)? Suppose you take a group of 1000 randomly selected husbands and find that 231 had cheated on their wives. Suppose in a group of 1200 randomly selected wives, 176 cheated on their husbands. Estimate the difference in the proportion of husbands and wives who cheat on their spouses using a 95% confidence level.\n\n#### Solution\n\n1.  State the random variables and the parameters in words.\n\nThese were stated in [Example: Hypothesis Test for Two Population Proportions].\n\n2.  State and check the conditions for the confidence interval\n\nThe conditions were stated and checked in [Example: Hypothesis Test for Two Population Proportions].\n\n3.  Find the sample statistics and the confidence interval\n\nOn r use the command:\n\n```{r prop-test9a}\nprop.test(c(231,176), c(1000, 1200), conf.level = .95)\n```\n\n4.  Statistical Interpretation: You are 95% confident that $0.05050705<p_1-p_2<0.11815962$ contains the true difference in proportions.\n\n5.  Real World Interpretation: The proportion of husbands who cheat on their wives is anywhere from 5.05% to 11.82% higher than the proportion of wives who cheat on their husband.\n\n### Homework for Two Proportions Section\n\n**In each problem show all steps of the hypothesis test or confidence interval. If some of the conditions are not met, note that the results of the test or interval may not be correct and then continue the process of the hypothesis test or confidence interval.**\n\n1.

A child dying from an accidental poisoning is a terrible incident. Is it more likely that a male child will get into poison than a female child? To find this out, data was collected that showed that out of 1830 children between the ages one and four who pass away from poisoning, 1031 were males and 799 were females (Flanagan, Rooney & Griffiths, 2005). Do the data show that there is different proportion of male children dying of poisoning than female children? Test at the 1% level.\n\n8.  A child dying from an accidental poisoning is a terrible incident. Is it more likely that a male child will get into poison than a female child?

Compute a 99% confidence interval for the difference in proportions of poisoning deaths of male and female children ages one to four.\n\n## Paired Samples for Two Means\n\nAre two populations the same? Is the average height of men taller than the average height of women? Is the mean weight less after a diet than before?\n\nYou can compare populations by comparing their means. You take a sample from each population and compare the statistics.\n\nAnytime you compare two populations you need to know if the samples are independent or dependent. The formulas you use are different for different types of samples.\n\nIf how you choose one sample has no effect on the way you choose the other sample, the two samples are **independent**. The way to think about it is that in independent samples, the observations from one sample are overall different from the observations from the other sample. This will mean that sample one has no affect on sample two. The sample values from one sample are not related or paired with values from the other sample.\n\nIf you choose the samples so that a measurement in one sample is paired with a measurement from the other sample, the samples are **dependent** or **matched** or **paired**. (Often a before and after situation.) You want to make sure the there is a meaning for pairing data values from one sample with a specific data value from the other sample. One way to think about it is that in dependent samples, the observations from one sample are the same observations from the other sample, though there can be other reasons to pair values. This makes the sample values from each sample paired.\n\nIn tidy data, remember each row is a unit of observation, and each column is a variable. In paired samples, you would have two variables that you are working with. In independent samples, you would have a variable that distinguishes an observation from another observation. As an example, in the Pulse data frame, consider the variables pulse_before and pulse_after. Since they are measured off the same observation, then comparing the two variables would be a paired samples analysis. However, consider the pulse_after and whether a person smokes would be comparing the variable pulse_after against the variable smokes to see if smoking effects a person's pulse rate after exercise. In this case, the observations would be different based on smoking yes or smoking no. Consider the variable smoking to be the factor that one is interested in seeing how it effects pulse rate in the data frame @tbl-Pulse.\n\n### Example: Independent or Dependent Samples\n\nDetermine if the following are dependent or independent samples.\n\na.  Randomly choose 5 men and 6 women and compare their heights\nb.  Choose 10 men and weigh them. Give them a new diet drug and later weigh them again.\nc.  Take 10 people and measure the strength of their dominant arm and their non-dominant arm.\n\n#### Solution\n\na.  Randomly choose 5 men and 6 women and compare their heights\n\n    Independent, since there is no reason that one value belongs to another. The units of observations are not the same for both samples. The units of observations are definitely different. A way to think about this is that the knowledge that a man is chosen in one sample does not give any information about any of the woman chosen in the other sample.\n\n<!-- -->\n\nb.  Choose 10 men and weigh them. Give them a new diet drug and later weigh them again.\n\n    Dependent, since each person's before weight can be matched with their after weight. The units of observations are the same for both samples. A way to think about this is that the knowledge that a person weighs 400 pounds at the beginning will tell you something about their weight after the diet drug.\n\nc.  Take 10 people and measure the strength of their dominant arm and their non-dominant arm.\n\n    Dependent, since you can match the two arm strengths. The units of observations are the same for both samples. So the knowledge of one person's dominant arm strength will tell you something about the strength of their non-dominant arm.\n\nTo analyze data when there are matched or paired samples, called dependent samples, you conduct a paired t-test. Since the samples are matched, you can find the difference between the values of the two random variables.\n\n### Hypothesis Test for Two Sample Paired t-Test\n\n1.  State the random variables and the parameters in words.\n\n$x_1$ = random variable 1\n\n$x_2$ = random variable 2\n\n$\\mu_1$ = mean of random variable 1\n\n$\\mu_2$ = mean of random variable 2\n\n2.  State the null and alternative hypotheses and the level of significance\n\nThe hypotheses would be\n\n$H_o:\\mu_1=\\mu_2$ or$H_o:\\mu_1-\\mu_2=0$\n\n$H_a:\\mu_1\\ne \\mu_2$ or $H_a:\\mu_1-\\mu_2\\ne0$\n\nHowever, since you are finding the differences, then you can actually think of $\\mu_1-\\mu_2=\\mu_d$.\n\nSo the hypotheses could become\n\n$H_o:\\mu_d=0$\n\n$H_a:\\mu_d\\ne 0$ Remember, you can replace $\\ne$ with $<$ or $>$.\n\nAlso, state your $\\alpha$ level here.\n\n3.  State and check the conditions for the hypothesis test\n\n<!-- -->\n\na.  State: A random sample of $n$ pairs is taken. Check: state how the sample was collected.\n\nb.  Check: The population of the difference between random variables is normally distributed. Check: In this case the population you are interested in has to do with the differences that you find. It does not matter if each random variable is normally distributed. It is only important if the differences you find are normally distributed. Just as before, the t-test is fairly robust to the condition if the sample size is large. This means that if this condition isn't met, but your sample size is quite large, then the results of the t-test are valid.\n\n<!-- -->\n\n4.  Find the sample statistic, test statistic, and p-value\n\nRealize that a paired test is a one sample t-test on the difference between two variables. So you are running a one-sample t-test on a new variable known as the difference variable. You need to create this difference variable by creating a new data frame. This is done on rStudio by doing the following command (The following shows how to create the variable difference for pulse_after-pulse_before on the data frame Pulse. Change the variables used and data frame used to your data frame and variables):\n\n```{r pulse9-new-data}\n#| tbl-alt: \"Table showing first 6 rows of Pulse dataset with difference column added\"\n#| warning: FALSE\n#| label: tbl-Pulse_Difference\n#| tbl-cap: \"Pulse Data frame with Difference Column Added\"\nPulse<-\n  Pulse |>\n  mutate(difference=pulse_after-pulse_before) \nknitr::kable(head(Pulse))\n```\n\nNotice rStudio added a new variable called difference to the data frame @tbl-Pulse_Difference. Now to conduct a paired t-test use the rStudio command\n\nt.test(\\~difference_variable, data=Data_Frame)\n\nNote: if the $H_a$ is \\<, then the command becomes\n\nt.test(\\~difference_variable, data=Data_Frame, alternative=\"less\")\n\nSimilarly for \\> put alternative=\"greater\"\n\n5.  Conclusion\n\nThis is where you write reject $H_o$ or fail to reject $H_o$. The rule is: if the p-value $<\\alpha$, then reject $H_o$. If the p-value $\\ge\\alpha$, then fail to reject $H_o$.\n\n6.  Interpretation\n\nThis is where you interpret in real world terms the conclusion to the test. The conclusion for a hypothesis test is that you either have enough evidence to support $H_a$, or you do not have enough evidence to support $H_a$.\n\n### Confidence Interval for Difference in Means from Paired Samples (t-Interval)\n\nThe confidence interval for the difference in means has the same random variables and means and the same conditions as the hypothesis test for two paired samples. If you have already completed the hypothesis test, then you do not need to state them again. If you haven't completed the hypothesis test, then state the random variables and means, and state and check the conditions before completing the confidence interval step.\n\n1.  Find the sample statistic and confidence interval. Again, you will need to create a new data frame with a difference variable. Then on rStudio the command is\n\n    t.test(\\~difference_variable, data=Data_Frame, conf.level=C) Type C as a decimal\n\n<!-- -->\n\n2.  Statistical Interpretation: In general this looks like, \"You are C% confident that the statement contains the true mean difference.\"\n\n3.  Real World Interpretation: This is where you state what interval contains the true mean difference.\n\n### Example: Hypothesis Test for Paired Samples\n\nIs the pulse rate after exercise different from the pulse rate before exercise for a woman who drinks alcohol? Use the data frame @tbl-Pulse. Test at the 5% level.\n\n**Code book for data frame Pulse below @tbl-Pulse.**\n\n#### Solution\n\n1.  State the random variables and the parameters in words.\n\n$x_1$ = pulse of a smoking woman who drinks alcohol after exercise\n\n$x_2$ = pulse of a smoking woman who drinks alcohol before exercise\n\n$\\mu_1$ = mean pulse of a smoking woman who drinks alcohol after exercise\n\n$\\mu_2$ = mean pulse of a smoking woman who drinks alcohol after exercise\n\n2.  State the null and alternative hypotheses and the level of significance\n\n$H_o: \\mu_1=\\mu_2$\n\n$H_a: \\mu_1\\ne \\mu_2$\n\nlevel of significance, $\\alpha=0.05$\n\n3.  State and check the conditions for the hypothesis test\n\n<!-- -->\n\na.  State: A random sample of 110 pairs of pulse rates after and before exercise was taken. Check: The data frame says that the data was collected from students in classes for several years. Though this was not a random sample, it is probably a representative sample.\n\nb.  State: The population of the difference in after and before pulse rates is normally distributed. Check: To see if this is true, look at the density plot and the normal quantile plot for the difference between after and before. This variable must be created before the density plot and normal quantile plot can be created. The data frame @tbl-Females is females who drink alcohol.\n\n```{r pulse9-female-data}\n#| tbl-alt: \"Pulse Rates Before and After Exercise of females who do drink alcohol with difference\"\n#| label: tbl-Females\n#| tbl-cap: \"Pulse Rates Before and After Exercise of Females who do drink Alcohol with Difference\"\nPulse_female<- \n  Pulse |> \n  filter(gender==\"female\", alcohol==\"yes\") \nknitr::kable(head(Pulse_female))\n```\n\nNow mutate @tbl-Females data frame to include a difference variable.\n\n```{r pulse9-female-new-data}\n#| tbl-alt: \"Table showing first 6 rows of Female Pulse dataset with difference column added\"\n#| warning: FALSE\n#| label: tbl-Females_difference\n#| tbl-cap: \"Pulse Rates Before and After Exercise of Females who do drink Alcohol with Difference\"\nPulse_female<-\n  Pulse_female |> \n  mutate(difference=pulse_after-pulse_before) \nknitr::kable(head(Pulse_female))\n```\n\nUsing @tbl-Females_difference create a density plot and normal quantile plot on the difference variable.\n\n```{r pulse9-female-density}\n#| fig-alt: \"Density plot of differences in pulse rates.

So you cannot assume that the distribution of the difference in pulse rates is normal. It is good that the t-test is robust if there is a large sample. The sample is of size 110, so that should be adequate to assume the conclusion is valid.\n\n4.  Find the sample statistic, test statistic, and p-value On r Studio, use the command:\n\n```{r pulse9-female-new-ttest}\nt.test(~difference, data=Pulse_female)\n```\n\n5.  Conclusion\n\nSince the p-value \\< 0.05, reject $H_o$.\n\n6.  Interpretation\n\nThere is enough evidence to support that there is a difference in pulse rate before and after exercise of females who smoke.\n\n### Example: Hypothesis Test for Paired Samples {#example-hypothesis-test-for-paired-samples-1}\n\nThe New Zealand Air Force purchased a batch of flight helmets. They then found out that the helmets didn't fit. In order to make sure that they order the correct size helmets, they measured the head size of recruits. To save money, they wanted to use cardboard calipers, but were not sure if they will be accurate enough. So they took 18 recruits and measured their heads with the cardboard calipers and also with metal calipers. The data frame is in @tbl-Helmet (Helmet Sizes for New Zealand Airforce, 2019). Do the data provide enough evidence to show that there is a difference in measurements between the cardboard and metal calipers? Use a 5% level of significance.\n\n```{r helmet9-data}\n#| tbl-alt: \"Table showing first 6 rows of Helmet dataset\"\n#| warning: FALSE\n#| label: tbl-Helmet\n#| tbl-cap: \"Helmet Head Measurments\"\nHelmet<-read.csv( \"https://krkozak.github.io/MAT160/helmet.csv\") \nknitr::kable(head(Helmet))\n```\n\n**Code book for data frame Helmet**\n\n**Description** After purchasing a batch of flight helmets that did not fit the heads of many pilots, the NZ Airforce decided to measure the head sizes of all recruits. Before this was carried out, information was collected to determine the feasibility of using cheap cardboard calipers to make the measurements, instead of metal ones which were expensive and uncomfortable. The data lists the head diameters of 18 recruits measured once using cardboard calipers and again using metal calipers. One question is whether there is any systematic difference between the two sets of calipers. One might also ask whether there is more variability in the cardboard calipers measurement than that of the metal calipers.\n\nThis data frame contains the following columns:\n\nCardboard: measurement using cardboard calipers (cm)\n\nMetal: measurement using metal calipers (cm)\n\nSource Helmet Sizes for New Zealand Airforce.

State and check the conditions for the hypothesis test\n\n<!-- -->\n\na.  State: A random sample of 18 pairs of head measures of recruits with cardboard and metal caliper was taken. Check: This was not stated, but probably could be safely assumed.\n\nb.  State: The population of the difference in head measurements between cardboard and metal calipers is normally distributed. Check: First create the difference variable, then the density plot and normal quantile plot.\n\n```{r helmet9a-data}\n#| tbl-alt: \"Table showing first 6 rows of Helmet dataset with difference column added\"\n#| warning: FALSE\n#| label: tbl-Helmet-difference\n#| tbl-cap: \"Helmet Head Measurments\"\nHelmet<-\n  Helmet |> \n  mutate(difference=Cardboard-Metal) \nknitr::kable(head(Helmet))\n```\n\n```{r helmet9-new-denstiy}\n#| fig.alt: \"Density plot of differences in head measurements, somewhat bell shaped\"\n#| warning: FALSE\n#| label: fig-helmet-density\n#| fig-cap: \"Density plot of differences in head measurements\"\ngf_density(~difference, data=Helmet, title=\"Differences in Head Measurements\", xlab=\"Difference Between Cardboard and Metal\") \n```\n\n```{r helmet9-new-qq}\n#| fig.alt: \"Normal quantile plot of differences in head measurements, somewhat linear\"\n#| warning: FALSE\n#| label: fig-helmet-qq\n#| fig-cap: \"Normal Quantile Plot of Differences in Head Measurements\"\ngf_qq(~difference, data=Helmet, title=\"Differences in Head Measurements\") \n```\n\nThis density plot @fig-helmet-density looks somewhat bell shaped. The normal quantile plot @fig-helmet-qq on the differences looks somewhat linear. So you can assume that the distribution of the difference in weights is normal.\n\n4.  Find the sample statistic, test statistic, and p-value\n\nUsing rStudio the command is\n\n```{r helmet9-ttest}\nt.test(~difference, data=Helmet)\n```\n\nThe sample statistic is 1.6111, the test statistic is 3.1854, and the p-value is 0.005415.\n\n5.  Conclusion\n\nSince the p-value $<$ 0.05, reject $H_o$.\n\n6.  Interpretation\n\nThere is enough evidence to support that the mean head measurements using the cardboard calipers are not the same as when using the metal calipers. So it looks like the New Zealand Air Force shouldn't use the cardboard calipers.\n\n### Example: Confidence Interval for Paired Samples\n\nThe New Zealand Air Force purchased a batch of flight helmets. They then found out that the helmets didn't fit. In order to make sure that they order the correct size helmets, they measured the head size of recruits. To save money, they wanted to use cardboard calipers, but were not sure if they will be accurate enough. So they took 18 recruits and measured their heads with the cardboard calipers and also with metal calipers. The data frame is in @tbl-Helmet (Helmet Sizes for New Zealand Airforce, 2019). Estimate the difference in measurements between the cardboard and metal calipers using a 95% confidence interval.\n\n#### Solution\n\n1.  State the random variables and the parameters in words.\n\nThese were stated in [Example: Hypothesis Test for Paired Samples](#example-hypothesis-test-for-paired-samples-1).\n\n2.  State and check the conditions for the confidence interval\n\nThe conditions were stated and checked in [Example: Hypothesis Test for Paired Samples](#example-hypothesis-test-for-paired-samples-1).\n\n3.  Find the sample statistic and confidence interval\n\nUsing the data frame @tbl-Helmet-difference the rStudio the command is\n\n```{r helmet9-confinterval}\nt.test(~difference, data=Helmet, conf.leve=0.95)\n```\n\n4.  Statistical Interpretation: You are 95% confidence that $0.5440163<\\mu_1-\\mu_2<2.6782060$ contains the true mean difference in head measurement between using the cardboard and metal calibers.\n\n5.  Real World Interpretation: The mean head measurement using the cardboard calibers is anywhere from 0.54 cm to 2.68 cm more than the head measurement using the metal calibers.\n\nExamples 9.2.6 and 9.2.7 use the same data set, but one is conducting a hypothesis test and the other is conducting a confidence interval. Notice that the hypothesis test's conclusion was to reject and say that there was a difference in the means, and the confidence interval does not contain the number 0. If the confidence interval did contain the number 0, then that would mean that the two means could be the same. Since the interval did not contain 0, then you could say that the means are different just as in the hypothesis test. This means that the hypothesis test and the confidence interval can produce the same interpretation. Do be careful though, you can run a hypothesis test with a particular significance level and a confidence interval with a confidence level that is not compatible with your significance level. This will mean that the conclusion from the confidence interval would not be the same as with a hypothesis test. So if you want to estimate the mean difference, then conduct a confidence interval. If you want to show that the means are different, then conduct a hypothesis test. As a reminder, the American Statistical Association (ASA) suggests not conducting hypothesis tests and just create confidence intervals.\n\n### Homework for Paired Samples for Two Means Section\n\n**In each problem show all steps of the hypothesis test or confidence interval.

As with all other hypothesis tests and confidence intervals, the process is the same though the formulas and conditions are different.\n\n### Hypothesis Test for the Difference in Means from Two Independent Samples\n\n1.  State the random variables and the parameters in words.\n\n$x_1$ = random variable 1\n\n$x_2$= random variable 2\n\n$\\mu_1$= mean of random variable 1\n\n$\\mu_2$= mean of random variable 2\n\n2.  State the null and alternative hypotheses and the level of significance\n\nThe hypotheses would be\n\n$H_o:\\mu_1=\\mu_2$\n\n$H_a:\\mu_1\\ne \\mu_2$, the $\\ne$ can be replaced with $<$ or $>$\n\nAlso, state your $\\alpha$ level here.\n\n3.  State and check the conditions for the hypothesis test\n\n<!-- -->\n\na.  State: A random sample of size $n_1$ is taken from population 1. A random sample of size $n_2$ is taken from population 2. Check: describe how both samples are collected. Note: the samples do not need to be the same size, but the test is more robust if they are.\n\nb.  State: The two samples are independent. Check: describe whey the samples are independent of each other.\n\nc.  State: Population 1 is normally distributed. Population 2 is normally distributed. Check: draw the density graph and normal quantile plot for both samples and discuss if they meet the criteria. Just as before, the t-test is fairly robust to the condition if the sample size is large. This means that if this condition isn't met, but your sample sizes are quite large, then the results of the t-test are valid.\n\nd.  State: The population variances are unknown and not assumed to be equal. The old condition is that the variances are equal. However, this condition is no longer a condition that most statisticians use. This is because it isn't really realistic to assume that the variances are equal. So just assume the condition of the variances being unknown and not assumed to be equal is true, and it will not be checked.\n\n<!-- -->\n\n4.  Find the sample statistic, test statistic, and p-value\n\nThe command using r is\n\nt.test(variable\\~factor, data=Data_Frame)\n\nNote: if the $H_a$ is \\<, then the command becomes\n\nt.test(variable\\~factor, data=Data_Frame, alternative=\"less\")\n\nSimilarly for \\> put alternative=\"greater\"\n\n5.  Conclusion\n\nThis is where you write reject or fail to reject $H_0$. The rule is: if the p-value $<\\alpha$, then reject $H_o$. If the p-value $\\ge \\alpha$, then fail to reject $H_o$.\n\n6.  Interpretation\n\nThis is where you interpret in real world terms the conclusion to the test. The conclusion for a hypothesis test is that you either have enough evidence to support $H_a$, or you do not have enough evidence to support $H_a$.\n\n### Confidence Interval for the Difference in Means from Two Independent Samples\n\nThe confidence interval for the difference in means has the same random variables and means and the same conditions as the hypothesis test for independent samples. If you have already completed the hypothesis test, then you do not need to state them again. If you haven't completed the hypothesis test, then state the random variables and means and state and check the conditions before completing the confidence interval step.\n\nFind the sample statistic and confidence interval\n\nOn r Studio, the command is\n\nt.test(variable\\~factor, data=Data_Frame, conf.level=C) type C as a decimal\n\n2.  Statistical Interpretation: In general this looks like, \"You are C% confident that the interval contains the true mean difference.\"\n\n3.  Real World Interpretation: This is where you state what interval contains the true difference in means, though often you state how much more (or less) the first mean is from the second mean.\n\n### Example: Hypothesis Test for Two Means\n\nThe cholesterol level of people vary for many reasons. The question is do people with diabetes have different cholesterol levels from people who do not have diabetes? Use the NHANES data frame.

State and check the conditions for the hypothesis test\n\n<!-- -->\n\na.  State: A random sample of cholesterol levels of people with diabetes is taken. A random sample of cholesterol levels of people without diabetes is taken.\n\n    Check: The NHANES data frame uses cluster sampling which incorporates random sampling, so the sample is probably representative. This condition has been met.\n\nb.  State: The two samples are independent.\n\n    Check: This is because either they were dealing with people who have diabetes or not.\n\nc.

Using rStudio the command would be\n\n```{r NHANES9-confinterval}\nt.test(TotChol~Diabetes, data=NHANES, conf.level=0.95) \n```\n\n4.  Statistical Interpretation: You are 95% confident that the interval $0.02105115<\\mu_1-\\mu_2<0.19851114$ contains the true difference in means.\n\n5.  Real World Interpretation: The mean cholesterol level for people with diabetes is anywhere from 0.021 mmol/L to 0.199 mmol/L more than the mean cholesterol level for people without diabetes.\n\n### Example: Hypothesis Test for Two Means {#example-hypothesis-test-for-two-means-1}\n\nThe amount of sodium in beef and poultry hot dogs was measured. (\\\\\"SOCR 012708 id,\\\\\" 2013). The data is in @tbl-Hotdog. Is there enough evidence to show that beef has different amounts of sodium on average than poultry hot dogs? Use a 5% level of significance.\n\n```{r hotdog9a-data, warning=FALSE}\n#| tbl-alt: \"Table showing first 6 rows of Hotdog dataset\"\n#| label: tbl-Hotdog\n#| tbl-cap: \"Hot dog Data\"\nHotdog<-read.csv( \"https://krkozak.github.io/MAT160/hotdog_beef_poultry.csv\") \nknitr::kable(head(Hotdog))\n```\n\n**Code book for data frame Hot dog**\n\n**Description** Results of a laboratory analysis of calories and sodium content of major hot dog brands. Researchers for Consumer Reports analyzed three types of hot dog: beef, poultry, and meat (mostly pork and beef, but up to 15% poultry meat). The meat was left off this data frame so a two-sample t-test could be performed.\n\nThis data frame contains the following columns:\n\ntype: Type of hot dog (beef or poultry)\n\ncalories: Calories per hot dog\n\nsodium: Milligrams of sodium per hot dog\n\nSource SOCR 012708 id data hotdogs.

State the random variables and the parameters in words.\n\n$x_1$ = sodium level in beef hot dogs\n\n$x_2$ = sodium level in poultry hot dogs\n\n$\\mu_1$ = mean sodium level in beef hot dogs\n\n$\\mu_2$ = mean sodium level in poultry hot dogs\n\n2.  State the null and alternative hypotheses and the level of significance\n\nThe hypotheses would be\n\n$H_o:\\mu_1=\\mu_2$\n\n$H_o:\\mu_1\\ne \\mu_2$\n\nlevel of significance: $\\alpha=0.05$\n\n3.  State and check the conditions for the hypothesis test\n\n<!-- -->\n\na.  State: A random sample of 20 sodium levels in beef hot dogs is taken. A random sample of 20 sodium levels in poultry hot dogs.\n\n    Check: The code does not state if either sample was randomly selected, but since Consumer Reports performed the test, it is safe to assume the samples were both random.\n\nb.  State: The two samples are independent.\n\n    Check: These are different types of hot dogs so this is true.\n\nc.  State; Population of all sodium levels in beef hot dogs is normally distributed. Population of all sodium levels in poultry hot dogs is normally distributed.\n\n    Check:\n\n```{r hotdog9-density}\n#| fig.alt: \"Density plot of sodium amount faceted by type. Neither looks bell shaped.\"\n#| warning: FALSE\n#| label: fig-density-Hotdog\n#| fig-cap: \"Density Plot of Sodium Amount in Hot Dogs facetted by Type of Meat\"\ngf_density(~sodium|type, data=Hotdog, title=\"Sodium amount in Hot Dogs facetted by Type of Meat\", xlab=\"Total Sodium Level\") \n```\n\nThe density plot for beef hot dogs looks somewhat bell shaped, but the density plot for poultry hot dogs does not look bell shaped.\n\n```{r hotdog9-qq}\n#| fig.alt: \"Normal quantile plot of sodium amount faceted by type.

The normal quantile plot @fig-quantile-Hotdog for the sodium level in poultry hot dogs does not look linear. The population of all sodium levels in beef hot dogs may be normally distributed, but the population of all sodium levels in poultry hot dogs is probably not normally distributed. The sample size is not very large so the results of the test may not be valid. A larger sample would be a good idea.\n\n4.  Find the sample statistic, test statistic, and p-value\n\nUsing rStudio the variable is sodium levels (sodium) in different types of hot dogs. So the factor is type. The command is\n\n```{r hotdog9-ttest}\nt.test(sodium~type, data=Hotdog)\n```\n\n5.  Conclusion: Fail to reject $H_o$ since the p-value $\\ge \\alpha$.\n\n6.  Interpretation\n\nThis is not enough evidence to support that beef hot dogs' sodium level is different from poultry hot dogs. (Though do realize that the population conditions is not valid, so this interpretation may be invalid.)\n\n### Example: Confidence Interval for Two Independent Samples\n\nThe amount of sodium in beef and poultry hot dogs was measured. (\"SOCR 012708 id,\" 2013). The data is in @tbl-Hotdog. Find a 95% confidence interval for the mean difference in sodium levels between beef and poultry hot dogs.\n\n#### Solution\n\n1.  State the random variables and the parameters in words.\n\n    These were stated in [Example: Hypothesis Test for Two Means](#example-hypothesis-test-for-two-means-1).\n\n2.  State and check the conditions for the hypothesis test\n\nThe conditions were stated and checked in [Example: Hypothesis Test for Two Means](#example-hypothesis-test-for-two-means-1).\n\n3.  Find the sample statistic and confidence interval Using r Studio the variable is sodium levels (sodium) in different types of hot dogs. So the factor is type. The command is\n\n```{r hotdog9-confinterval}\nt.test(sodium~type, data=Hotdog, conf.level=0.95)\n```\n\n4.  Statistical Interpretation: You are 95% confident that the interval $-120.325706<\\mu_1-\\mu_2<4.625706$ contains the true difference in mean sodium level between beef and poultry hot dogs.\n\n5.  Real World Interpretation: The mean sodium level of beef hot dogs is anywhere from 120.33 mg less than the mean sodium level of poultry hot dogs to 4.63 mg more. (The negative sign on the lower limit implies that the first mean is less than the second mean. The positive sign on the upper limit implies that the first mean is greater than the second mean.)\n\nDo realize that the population conditions is not valid, so this interpretation may be invalid.\n\n### Homework for Independent Samples for Two Means Section\n\n**In each problem show all steps of the hypothesis test or confidence interval.

To help you to figure out the analysis to conduct, there are a series of questions you should ask yourself.\n\n1.  Does the problem deal with mean or proportion?\n\nSometimes the problem states explicitly the words mean or proportion, but other times you have to figure it out based on the information you are given. If you counted number of individuals that responded in the affirmative to a question, then you are dealing with proportion. If you measured something, then you are dealing with mean.\n\n2.  Does the problem have one or two samples?\n\nSo look to see if one group was measured or if two groups were measured. You need to decide if the problem describes collecting data from one group or from two groups, or if you are comparing two different groups.\n\n3.  If you have two samples, then you need to determine if the samples are independent or dependent.\n\nIf the individuals are different for both samples, then most likely the samples are independent. If you can't tell, then determine if a data value from the first sample influences the data value in the second sample. In other words, can you pair data values together so you can find the difference, and that difference has meaning. If the answer is yes, then the samples are paired. Otherwise, the samples are independent.\n\n4.  Does the situation involve a hypothesis test or a confidence interval?\n\nIf the problem talks about \"do the data show\", \"is there evidence of\", \"test to see\", then you are doing a hypothesis test. If the problem talks about \"find the value\", \"estimate the\" or \"find the interval\", then you are doing a confidence interval.\n\nSo if you have a situation that has two samples, independent samples, involving the mean, and is a hypothesis test, then you have a two-sample independent t-test. Now you look up the conditions and the technology process for doing this test. Every hypothesis test involves the same six steps, and you just have to use the correct conditions and calculations. Every confidence interval has the same five steps, and again you just need to use the correct conditions and calculations. So this is why it is so important to figure out what analysis you should conduct.\n"},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"output-file":"Two
