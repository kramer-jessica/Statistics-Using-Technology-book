There are two branches of inferential statistics: hypothesis testing and confidence intervals.\n\n**Hypothesis Testing**: making a decision about a parameter(s) based on a statistic(s).\n\n**Confidence Interval**: estimating a parameter(s) based on a statistic(s).\n\nThis chapter will describe hypothesis testing, but as was stated in Chapter 1, the American Statistical Association (ASA) is suggesting not discussing statistical significance and p-values. So this chapter is mostly for background to understand previously published studies.\n\n\nTo understand the process of a hypothesis tests, you need to first have an understanding of what a hypothesis is, which is an educated guess about a parameter. Once you have the hypothesis, you collect data and use the data to make a determination to see if there is enough evidence to show that the hypothesis is true. However, in hypothesis testing you actually assume something else is true, and then you look at your data to see how likely it is to get an event that your data demonstrates with that assumption. If the event is very unusual, then you might think that your assumption is actually false. If you are able to say this assumption is false, then your hypothesis must be true. This is known as a proof by contradiction. You assume the opposite of your hypothesis is true and show that it can't be true. If this happens, then your hypothesis must be true. All hypothesis tests go through the same process. Once you have the process down, then the concept is much easier. It is easier to see the process by looking at an example. Concepts that are needed will be detailed in this example.\n\n### Example: Basics of Hypothesis Testing\n\nSuppose a manufacturer of the XJ35 battery claims the mean life of the battery is 500 days with a standard deviation of 25 days. You are the buyer of this battery and you think this claim is incorrect. You would like to test your belief because without a good reason you can't get out of your contract.\n\n#### **Solution**\n\nWhat do you do?\n\nWell first, you should know what you are trying to measure. Define the random variable.\n\nLet $x$ = life of a XJ35 battery\n\nNow you are not just trying to find different \\$x\\$ values. You are trying to find what the true mean is. Since you are trying to find it, it must be unknown. You don't think it is 500 days. If you did, you wouldn't be doing any testing. The true mean, $\\mu$, is unknown. That means you should define that too.\n\nLet $\\mu$ = mean life of a XJ35 battery\n\nNow what?\n\nYou may want to collect a sample. What kind of sample?\n\nYou could ask the manufacturers to give you batteries, but there is a chance that there could be some bias in the batteries they pick. To reduce the chance of bias, it is best to take a random sample.\n\nHow big should the sample be?\n\nA sample of size 30 or more means that you can use the central limit theorem. Pick a sample of size 50.\n\n@tbl-Battery contains the data for the sample you collected:\n\n```{r battery-data}\n#| tbl-alt: \"Head of Data on Battery Life\"\n#| label: tbl-Battery\n#| tbl-cap: \"Data on Battery Life\"\nBattery<- read.csv( \"https://krkozak.github.io/MAT160/battery.csv\") \nknitr::kable(head(Battery))\n```\n\nNow what should you do? Looking at the data set, you see some of the times are above 500 and some are below. But looking at all of the numbers is too difficult. It might be helpful to calculate the mean for this sample.\n\n```{r battery-data-stats}\ndf_stats(~life, data=Battery, mean)\n```\n\nThe sample mean is 491.42 days. Looking at the sample mean, one might think that you are right. However, the standard deviation and the sample size also plays a role, so maybe you are wrong.\n\nBefore going any farther, it is time to formalize a few definitions.\n\nYou have a guess that the mean life of a battery is not 500 days. This is opposed to what the manufacturer claims. There really are two hypotheses, which are just guesses here --- the one that the manufacturer claims and the one that you believe. It is helpful to have names for them.\n\n**Null Hypothesis**: historical value, claim, or product specification. The symbol used is $H_o$.\n\n**Alternate Hypothesis**: what you want to prove. This is what you want to accept as true when you reject the null hypothesis. There are two symbols that are commonly used for the alternative hypothesis: $H_a$ or $H_1$. The symbol $H_a$ will be used in this book.\n\nIn general, the hypotheses look something like this:\n\n$H_0:\\mu=\\mu_o$\n\n$H_a:\\mu\\ne \\mu_o$\n\nwhere $\\mu_o$ just represents the value that the claim says the population mean is actually equal to.\n\nAlso, $H_a$ can be less than, greater than, or not equal to, though not equal to is more common these days.\n\nFor this problem:\n\n$H_o:\\mu=500\\text{ days}$, since the manufacturer says the mean life of a battery is 500 days.\n\n$H_a:\\mu\\ne 500\\text{ days}$, since you believe that the mean life of the battery is not 500 days.\n\nNow back to the mean. You have a sample mean of 491.42 days. Is this different enough to believe that you are right and the manufacturer is wrong? How different does it have to be?\n\nIf you calculated a sample mean of 235 or 690, you would definitely believe the population mean is not 500. But even if you had a sample mean of 435 or 575 you would probably believe that the true mean was not 500. What about 475? or 535? Or 483? or 514? There is some point where you would stop being so sure that the population mean is not 500. That point separates the values of where you are sure or pretty sure that the mean is not 500 from the area where you are not so sure. How do you find that point?\n\nWell it depends on how much error you want to make. Of course you don't want to make any errors, but unfortunately that is unavoidable in statistics. You need to figure out how much error you made with your sample. Take the sample mean, and find the probability of getting another sample mean less than it, assuming for the moment that the manufacturer is right. The idea behind this is that you want to know what is the chance that you could have come up with your sample mean even if the population mean really is 500 days.\n\nChances are probabilities. So you want to find the probability that the sample mean of 491.42 is unusual given that the population mean is really 500 days. To compute this probability, you need to know how the sample mean is distributed. Since the sample size is at least 30, then you know the sample mean is approximately normally distributed. Now, you want to find the $z$-value. The $z$-value is $z=\\frac{491.42-500}{\\frac{25}{\\sqrt{50}}}=-2.43$.\n\nThis is more than 2 standard deviations below the mean, so that seems that the sample mean is usual. It might be helpful to find the probability though. Since you are saying that the sample mean is different from 500 days, then you are asking if it is greater than or less than. This means that you are in the tails of the normal curve. So the probability you want to find is the probability being more than 2.43 or less than $-2.43$. This is $P(-2.43<z)+P(z>2.43)=0.015$\n\n```{r pnorm6}\npnorm(-2.43, 0, 1, lower.tail=TRUE)+pnorm(2.43, 0, 1, lower.tail=FALSE) \n```\n\nSo the probability of being in the tails is 0.015. This probability is known as a p-value for probability-value. This is unusual, so it is unlikely to get a sample mean of 491.42 if the population mean is 500 days.\n\nSo it appears the assumption that the population mean is 500 days is wrong, and you can reject the manufacturer's claim.\n\nBut how do you quantify really small? Is 5% or 10% or 15% really small? How do you decide?\n\nBefore you answer that question, a couple more definitions are needed.\n\n**Test statistic**: $z=\\frac{\\bar{x}-\\mu_o}{\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}}$ since it is calculated as part of the testing of the hypothesis\n\n**p - value**: probability that the test statistic will take on more extreme values than the observed test statistic, given that the null hypothesis is true. It is the probability that was calculated above.\n\nNow, how small is small enough? To answer that, you really want to know the types of errors you can make.\n\nThere are actually only two errors that can be made. The first error is if you say that is false, when in fact it is true. This means you reject when was true. The second error is if you say that is true, when in fact it is false. This means you fail to reject when is false. The following table organizes this for you:\n\n### Type of errors:\n\n|                   | Ho true      | Ho false      |\n|-------------------|--------------|---------------|\n| Reject Ho         | Type I error | no error      |\n| Fail to reject Ho | no error     | Type II error |\n\n: Type of errors\n\nThus\n\n**Type I Error** is rejecting $H_o$ when $H_o$ is true, and\n\n**Type II Error** is failing to reject $H_o$ when is $H_o$ false.\n\nSince these are the errors, then one can define the probabilities attached to each error.\n\n$\\alpha$= P(type I error) = P(rejecting\\$H_o\\$ given it is true)\n\n$\\beta$= P(type II error) = P(failing to reject\\$H_o\\$ given it is false)\n\n$\\alpha$ is also called the **level of significance**.\n\nAnother common concept that is used is Power = $1-\\beta$\n\nNow there is a relationship between $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$. They are not complements of each other. How are they related?\n\nIf $\\alpha$ increases that means the chances of making a type I error will increase. It is more likely that a type I error will occur. It makes sense that you are less likely to make type II errors, only because you will be rejecting more often. You will be failing to reject less, and therefore, the chance of making a type II error will decrease. Thus, as $\\alpha$ increases, $\\beta$ will decrease, and vice versa. That makes them seem like complements, but they aren't complements. What gives? Consider one more factor \\-- sample size.\n\nConsider if you have a larger sample that is representative of the population, then it makes sense that you have more accuracy then with a smaller sample. Think of it this way, which would you trust more, a sample mean of 490 if you had a sample size of 35 or sample size of 350 (assuming a representative sample)? Of course the 350 because there are more data points and so more accuracy. If you are more accurate, then there is less chance that you will make any error. By increasing the sample size of a representative sample, you decrease both $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$.\n\nSummary of all of this:\n\n1.  For a certain sample size, $\\alpha$ increases, $\\beta$ decreases.\n\n2.  For a certain level of significance, $\\alpha$, if $n$ increases, $\\beta$ decreases.\n\nNow how do you find $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$? Well $\\alpha$ is actually chosen. There are only two values that are usually picked for $\\alpha$: 0.01 and 0.05. is very difficult to find $\\beta$, so usually it isn't found. If you want to make sure it is small you take as large of a sample as you can afford provided it is a representative sample. This is one use of the Power. You want to be small and the Power of the test is large. The Power word sounds good.\n\nWhich pick of $\\alpha$ do you pick? Well that depends on what you are working on. Remember in this example you are the buyer who is trying to get out of a contract to buy these batteries. If you create a type I error, you said that the batteries are bad when they aren't, most likely the manufacturer will sue you. You want to avoid this. You might pick $\\alpha$ to be 0.01. This way you have a small chance of making a type I error. Of course this means you have more of a chance of making a type II error. No big deal right? What if the batteries are used in pacemakers and you tell the person that their pacemaker's batteries are good for 500 days when they actually last less, that might be bad. If you make a type II error, you say that the batteries do last 500 days when they last less, then you have the possibility of killing someone. You certainly do not want to do this. In this case you might want to pick $\\alpha$ as 0.05. If both errors are equally bad, then pick $\\alpha$ as 0.05.\n\nThe above discussion is why the choice of depends on what you are researching. As the researcher, you are the one that needs to decide what level to use based on your analysis of the consequences of making each error is.\n\nIf a type I error is really bad, then pick $\\alpha$= 0.01.\n\nIf a type II error is really bad, then pick $\\alpha$= 0.05\n\nIf neither error is bad, or both are equally bad, then pick $\\alpha$ = 0.05\n\nUsually $\\alpha$ is picked to be 0.05 in most cases.\n\nThe main thing is to always pick the $\\alpha$ before you collect the data and start the test.\n\nThe above discussion was long, but it is really important information. If you don't know what the errors of the test are about, then there really is no point in making conclusions with the tests. Make sure you understand what the two errors are and what the probabilities are for them.\n\nNow it is time to go back to the example and put this all together. This is the basic structure of testing a hypothesis, usually called a hypothesis test. Since this one has a test statistic involving $z$, it is also called a $z$-test. And since there is only one sample, it is usually called a one-sample $z$-test.\n\n### Example: Battery Example Revisited.\n\nSteps of a hypothesis test:\n\n1.  State the random variable and the parameter in words\n2.  State the null and alternative hypothesis and the level of significance\n3.  State and check the conditions for a hypothesis test\n4.  Find the sample statistic, test statistic, and p-value\n5.  Conclusion:\n6.  Interpretation:\n\n#### Solution\n\n1.  State the random variable and the parameter in words\n\n$x$ = life of battery\n\n$\\mu$ = mean life of a XJ35 battery\n\n2.  State the null and alternative hypothesis and the level of significance\n\n$H_o:\\mu=500$\n\n$H_a:\\mu\\ne500$\n\n$\\alpha$ = 0.05 (from above discussion about consequences)\n\n3.  State and check the conditions for a hypothesis test\n\nEvery hypothesis has some conditions that be met to make sure that the results of the hypothesis are valid. The conditions are different for each test. This test has the following conditions.\n\na.  A random sample of size $n$ is taken.\n\nThis occurred in this example, since it was stated that a random sample of 50 battery lives were taken.\n\nb.  The population standard deviation is known.\n\nThis is true, since it was given in the problem.\n\nc.  The sample size is at least 30 or the population of the random variable is normally distributed.\n\nThe sample size was 30, so this condition is met.\n\n4.  Find the sample statistic, test statistic, and p-value\n\nThe test statistic depends on how many samples there are, what parameter you are testing, and conditions that need to be checked. In this case, there is one sample and you are testing the mean. The conditions were checked above.\n\nSample statistic:\n\n```{r battery-stats}\ndf_stats(~life, data=Battery, mean)\n```\n\nTest statistic: The z-value is $z=\\frac{491.42-400}{\\frac{25}{\\sqrt{n}}}=-2.43$.\n\np-value: $P(-2.43<z)+P(z>2.43)=0.015$\n\n5.  Conclusion:\n\nNow what? Well, this p-value is 0.015. This is a lot smaller than the amount of error you would accept in the problem $\\alpha$ = 0.05. That means that finding a sample mean less than 490 days is unusual to happen if is true. This should make you think that is not true. You should reject $H_o$.\n\nIn fact, in general:\n\nReject $H_o$ if the p-value $<\\alpha$\n\nFail to reject $H_o$ if the p-value $\\ge\\alpha$.\n\n6.  Interpretation:\n\nSince you rejected $H_o$, what does this mean in the real world? That it what goes in the interpretation. Since you rejected the claim by the manufacturer that the mean life of the batteries is 500 days, then you now can believe that your hypothesis was correct. In other words, there is enough evidence to support that the mean life of the battery is less than 500 days.\n\nNow that you know that the batteries last less than 500 days, should you cancel the contract? Statistically, there is evidence that the batteries do not last as long as the manufacturer says they should. However, based on this sample there are only ten days less on average that the batteries last. There may not be practical significance in this case. Ten days do not seem like a large difference. In reality, if the batteries are used in pacemakers, then you would probably tell the patient to have the batteries replaced every year. You have a large buffer whether the batteries last 490 days or 500 days. It seems that it might not be worth it to break the contract over ten days. What if the 10 days was practically significant? Are there any other things you should consider? You might look at the business relationship with the manufacturer. You might also look at how much it would cost to find a new manufacturer. These are also questions to consider before making any changes. What this discussion should show you is that just because a hypothesis has statistical significance does not mean it has practical significance. The hypothesis test is just one part of a research process. There are other pieces that you need to consider.\n\nThat's it. That is what a hypothesis test looks like. All hypothesis tests are done with the same six steps. Those general six steps are outlined below.\n\n### Steps for hypothesis test\n\n1.  State the random variable and the parameter in words. This is where you are defining what the unknowns are in this problem.\n\n$x$ = random variable\n\n$\\mu$ = mean of random variable, if the parameter of interest is the mean. There are other parameters you can test, and you would use the appropriate symbol for that parameter.\n\n2.  State the null and alternative hypotheses and the level of significance\n\n$H_o:\\mu=\\mu_o$, where $\\mu_o$ is the known mean\n\n$H_a:\\mu\\ne\\mu_o$, You can replace $\\ne$ with $<$ or $>$ but usually you use $\\ne$\n\nAlso, state your level here.\n\n3.  State and check the conditions for a hypothesis test\n\nEach hypothesis test has its own conditions. They will be stated when the different hypothesis tests are discussed.\n\n4.  Find the sample statistic, test statistic, and p-value\n\nThis depends on what parameter you are working with, how many samples, and the conditions of the test. Technology will be used to find the sample statistic, test statistic, and p-value.\n\n5.  Conclusion\n\nThis is where you write reject $H_o$ or fail to reject $H_o$. The rule is: if the p-value $<\\alpha$, then reject $H_o$. If the p-value $\\ge\\alpha$, then fail to reject $H_o$\n\n6.  Interpretation\n\nThis is where you interpret in real world terms the conclusion to the test. The conclusion for a hypothesis test is that you either have enough evidence to support $H_a$, or you do not have enough evidence to support $H_a$.\n\nSorry, one more concept about the conclusion and interpretation. First, the conclusion is that you reject or you fail to reject \\$H_o\\$. Why was it said like this? It is because you never accept the null hypothesis. If you wanted to accept the null hypothesis, then why do the test in the first place? In the interpretation, you either have enough evidence to support $H_a$, or you do not have enough evidence to support $H_a$. You wouldn't want to go to all this work and then find out you wanted to accept the claim. Why go through the trouble? You always want to have enough evidence to support the alternative hypothesis. Sometimes you can do that and sometimes you can't. If you don't have enough evidence to support $H_a$, it doesn't mean you support the null hypothesis; it just means you can't support the alternative hypothesis. Here is an example to demonstrate this.\n\n### Example: Conclusions in Hypothesis Tests\n\nIn the U.S. court system a jury trial could be set up as a hypothesis test. To really help you see how this works, let's use OJ Simpson as an example. In the court system, a person is presumed innocent until he/she is proven guilty, and this is your null hypothesis. OJ Simpson was a football player in the 1970s. In 1994 his ex-wife and her friend were killed. OJ Simpson was accused of the crime, and in 1995 the case was tried. The prosecutors wanted to prove OJ was guilty of killing his wife and her friend, and that is the alternative hypothesis. In this case, a verdict of not guilty was given. That does not mean that he is innocent of this crime. It means there was not enough evidence to prove he was guilty. Many people believe that OJ was guilty of this crime, but the jury did not feel that the evidence presented was enough to show there was guilt. The verdict in a jury trial is always guilty or not guilty!\n\nThe same is true in a hypothesis test. There is either enough or not enough evidence to support the alternative hypothesis. It is not that you proved the null hypothesis true.\n\nWhen identifying hypothesis, it is important to state your random variable and the appropriate parameter you want to make a decision about. If you count something, then the random variable is the number of whatever you counted. The parameter is the proportion of what you counted. If the random variable is something you measured, then the parameter is the mean of what you measured. (Note: there are other parameters you can calculate, and some analysis of those will be presented in later chapters.)\n\n### Example: Stating Hypotheses\n\nIdentify the hypotheses necessary to test the following statements:\n\na.  The average salary of a teacher is different from \\\\\\$30,000.\nb.  The proportion of students who like math is not 10%.\nc.  The average age of students in this class differs from 21.\n\n#### **Solution**\n\na.  The average salary of a teacher is different from \\\\\\$30,000.\n\n$x$ = salary of teacher\n\n$\\mu=$ mean salary of teacher\n\nThe guess is that $\\mu\\ne30000$ and that is the alternative hypothesis.\n\nThe null hypothesis has the same parameter and number with an equal sign.\n\n$H_o:\\mu=30000$ $H_a:\\mu\\ne30000$\n\nb.  The proportion of students who like math is not 10%.\n\n$x$ = number of students who like math\n\n$p$ = proportion of students who like math\n\nThe guess is that $p$ is not 0.10 and that is the alternative hypothesis. $H_a:p\\ne0.10$ and the null hypothesis would be $H_o:p=0.10$\n\nc.  The average age of students in this class differs from 21.\n\n$x$ = age of students in this class\n\n$\\mu$=mean age of students in this class\n\nThe guess is that $\\mu\\ne21$ and that is the alternative hypothesis. $H_a:\\mu\\ne21$ and the null hypothesis would be $H_o: \\mu=21$\n\n### Example: Stating Type I and II Errors and Picking Level of Significance\n\na.  The plant-breeding department at a major university developed a new hybrid raspberry plant called YumYum Berry. Based on research data, the claim is made that from the time shoots are planted 90 days on average are required to obtain the first berry with a standard deviation of 9.2 days. A corporation that is interested in marketing the product tests 60 shoots by planting them and recording the number of days before each plant produces its first berry. The sample mean is 92.3 days. The corporation wants to know if the mean number of days is more than the 90 days claimed. State the type I and type II errors in terms of this problem, consequences of each error, and state which level of significance to use.\nb.  A concern was raised in Australia that the percentage of deaths of Aboriginal prisoners was higher than the percent of deaths of non-indigenous prisoners, which is 0.27%. State the type I and type II errors in terms of this problem, consequences of each error, and state which level of significance to use.\n\n#### **Solution**\n\na.  The plant-breeding department at a major university developed a new hybrid raspberry plant called YumYum Berry. Based on research data, the claim is made that from the time shoots are planted 90 days on average are required to obtain the first berry with a standard deviation of 9.2 days. A corporation that is interested in marketing the product tests 60 shoots by planting them and recording the number of days before each plant produces its first berry. The sample mean is 92.3 days.

State the type I and type II errors in terms of this problem, consequences of each error, and state which level of significance to use.\n\n$x$ = time to first berry for YumYum Berry plant\n\n$\\mu$= mean time to first berry for YumYum Berry plant\n\nType I Error: If the corporation does a type I error, then they will say that the plants take longer to produce than 90 days when they don't. They probably will not want to market the plants if they think they will take longer. They will not market them even though in reality the plants do produce in 90 days. They may have loss of future earnings, but that is all.\n\nType II error: The corporation do not say that the plants take longer then 90 days to produce when they do take longer. Most likely they will market the plants. The plants will take longer, and so customers might get upset and then the company would get a bad reputation. This would be really bad for the company.\n\nLevel of significance: It appears that the corporation would not want to make a type II error. Pick a 5% level of significance, $\\alpha=0.05$.\n\nb.  A concern was raised in Australia that the percentage of deaths of Aboriginal prisoners was higher than the percent of deaths of non-indigenous prisoners, which is 0.27%. State the type I and type II errors in terms of this problem, consequences of each error, and state which level of significance to use.\n\n$x$ = number of Aboriginal prisoners who have died\n\n$p$ = proportion of Aboriginal prisoners who have died\n\nType I error: Rejecting that the proportion of Aboriginal prisoners who died was 0.27%, when in fact it was 0.27%. This would mean you would say there is a problem when there isn't one. You could anger the Aboriginal community, and spend time and energy researching something that isn't a problem.\n\nType II error: Failing to reject that the proportion of Aboriginal prisoners who died was 0.27%, when in fact it is higher than 0.27%. This would mean that you wouldn't think there was a problem with Aboriginal prisoners dying when there really is a problem. You risk causing deaths when there could be a way to avoid them.\n\nLevel of significance: It appears that both errors may be issues in this case. You wouldn't want to anger the Aboriginal community when there isn't an issue, and you wouldn't want people to die when there may be a way to stop it. It may be best to pick a 5% level of significance, $\\alpha=0.05$.\n\nHint \\-- hypothesis testing is really easy if you follow the same recipe every time. The only differences in the various problems are the conditions of the test and the test statistic you calculate so you can find the p-value. Do the same steps, in the same order, with the same words, every time and these problems become very easy.\n\n### Homework for Basics of Hypothesis Testing Section\n\n**For the problems in this section, a question is being asked. This is to help you understand what the hypotheses are. You are not to run any hypothesis tests nor come up with any conclusions in this section.**\n\n1.  The Arizona Republic/Morrison/Cronkite News poll published on Monday, October 20, 2016, found 390 of the registered voters surveyed favor Proposition 205, which would legalize marijuana for adults. The statewide telephone poll surveyed 779 registered voters between Oct. 10 and Oct. 15. (Sanchez, 2016) Fifty-five percent of Colorado residents supported the legalization of marijuana. Does the data provide evidence that the percentage of Arizona residents who support legalization of marijuana is different from the proportion of Colorado residents who support it? State the random variable, population parameter, and hypotheses.\n\n2.  According to the February 2008 Federal Trade Commission report on consumer fraud and identity theft, 23% of all complaints in 2007 were for identity theft. In that year, Alaska had 321 complaints of identity theft out of 1,432 consumer complaints (\\\\\"Consumer fraud and,\\\\\" 2008). Does this data provide enough evidence to show that Alaska had a different proportion of identity theft than 23%? State the random variable, population parameter, and hypotheses.\n\n3.  The Kyoto Protocol was signed in 1997, and required countries to start reducing their carbon emissions. The protocol became enforceable in February 2005. In 2004, the mean CO2 emission was 4.87 metric tons per capita. Is there enough evidence to show that the mean CO2 emission is different in 2010 than in 2004? State the random variable, population parameter, and hypotheses.\n\n4.  The FDA regulates that fish that is consumed is allowed to contain 1.0 mg/kg of mercury. In Florida, bass fish were collected in 53 different lakes to measure the amount of mercury in the fish. Do the data provide enough evidence to show that the fish in Florida lakes has a different amount of mercury than the allowable amount? State the random variable, population parameter, and hypotheses.\n\n5.

Does the data provide evidence that the percentage of Arizona residents who support legalization of marijuana is different from the proportion of Colorado residents who support it. State the type I and type II errors in this case, consequences of each error type for this situation from the perspective of the manufacturer, and the appropriate alpha level to use. State why you picked this alpha level.\n\n6.  According to the February 2008 Federal Trade Commission report on consumer fraud and identity theft, 23% of all complaints in 2007 were for identity theft. In that year, Alaska had 321 complaints of identity theft out of 1,432 consumer complaints (\\\\\"Consumer fraud and,\\\\\" 2008). Does this data provide enough evidence to show that Alaska had a different proportion of identity theft than 23%? State the type I and type II errors in this case, consequences of each error type for this situation from the perspective of the state of Alaska, and the appropriate alpha level to use. State why you picked this alpha level.\n\n7.  The Kyoto Protocol was signed in 1997, and required countries to start reducing their carbon emissions. The protocol became enforceable in February 2005. In 2004, the mean CO2 emission was 4.87 metric tons per capita. Is there enough evidence to show that the mean CO2 emission is lower in 2010 than in 2004? State the type I and type II errors in this case, consequences of each error type for this situation from the perspective of the agency overseeing the protocol, and the appropriate alpha level to use. State why you picked this alpha level.\n\n8.  The FDA regulates that fish that is consumed is allowed to contain 1.0 mg/kg of mercury. In Florida, bass fish were collected in 53 different lakes to measure the amount of mercury in the fish. Do the data provide enough evidence to show that the fish in Florida lakes has different amount of mercury than the allowable amount? State the type I and type II errors in this case, consequences of each error type for this situation from the perspective of the FDA, and the appropriate alpha level to use. State why you picked this alpha level.\n\n## One-Sample Proportion Test\n\nThere are many different parameters that you can test. There is a test for the mean, such as was introduced with the \\$z\\$-test. There is also a test for the population proportion, $p$. This is where you might be curious if the proportion of students who smoke at your school is lower than the proportion in your area. Or you could question if the proportion of accidents caused by teenage drivers who do not have a drivers' education class is more than the national proportion.\n\nTo test a population proportion, there are a few things that need to be defined first. Usually, Greek letters are used for parameters and Latin letters for statistics. When talking about proportions, it makes sense to use $p$ for proportion. The Greek letter for $p$ is $\\pi$, but that is too confusing to use. Instead, it is best to use $p$ for the population proportion. That means that a different symbol is needed for the sample proportion. The convention is to use, $\\hat{p}$, known as p-hat. This way you know that $p$ is the population proportion, and that $\\hat{p}$ is the sample proportion related to it.\n\nNow proportion tests are about looking for the percentage of individuals who have a particular attribute. You are really looking for the number of successes that happen. Thus, a proportion test involves a binomial distribution.\n\n### **Hypothesis Test for One Population Proportion (1-Prop Test)**\n\n1.  State the random variable and the parameter in words.\n\n$x$ = number of successes\n\n$p$ = proportion of successes\n\n2.  State the null and alternative hypotheses and the level of significance\n\n$H_o:p=p_o$, where $p_o$ is the known proportion\n\n$H_a:p\\ne p_o$, you can also use \\< or \\>, but $\\ne$ is the more common one to use.\n\nAlso, state your $\\alpha$ level here.\n\n3.  State and check the conditions for a hypothesis test\n\n<!-- -->\n\na.  State: A simple random sample of size $n$ is taken. Check: describe how the sample was collected\n\nb.  State: The conditions for the binomial experiment are satisfied. Check: Show all four properties are true.\n\nc.  State: The sampling distribution of $\\hat{p}$ is normally distributed. Check: you need to show that $p*n\\ge5$ and $q*n\\ge5$, where $q=1-p$. If this requirement is true, then the sampling distribution of $\\hat{p}$ is well approximated by a normal curve.\n\n<!-- -->\n\n4.  Find the sample statistic, test statistic, and p-value\n\nThis will be computed on r Studio using the command\n\nprop.test(r, n, p=what_Ho_says)\n\nwhere $r$=observed number of successes and $n$ = number of trials.\n\n5.  Conclusion\n\nThis is where you write reject or fail to reject $H_o$. The rule is: if the p-value $<\\alpha$, then reject $H_0$. If the p-value $\\ge\\alpha$, then fail to reject $H_o$\n\n6.  Interpretation\n\nThis is where you interpret in real world terms the conclusion to the test. The conclusion for a hypothesis test is that you either have enough evidence to support $H_a$, or you do not have enough evidence to support $H_a$.\n\n### Example: Hypothesis Test for One Proportion\n\nA concern was raised in Australia that the percentage of deaths of Aboriginal prisoners was different than the percent of deaths of non-Aboriginal prisoners, which is 0.27%. A sample of six years (1990-1995) of data was collected, and it was found that out of 14,495 Aboriginal prisoners, 51 died (\\\\\"Indigenous deaths in,\\\\\" 1996). Do the data provide enough evidence to show that the proportion of deaths of Aboriginal prisoners is different from 0.27%?\n\n#### **Solution**\n\n1.  State the random variable and the parameter in words.\n\n$x$ = number of Aboriginal prisoners who die\n\n$p$ = proportion of Aboriginal prisoners who die\n\n2.  State the null and alternative hypotheses and the level of significance\n\n$H_o:p=0.0027$\n\n$H_a:p\\ne0.0027$\n\nFrom [Example: Stating Type I and II Errors and Picking Level of Significance] part b, the argument was made to pick 5% for the level of significance. So $\\alpha=0.05$\n\n3.  State and check the conditions for a hypothesis test\n\n<!-- -->\n\na.  A simple random sample of 14,495 Aboriginal prisoners was taken. Check: The sample was not a random sample, since it was data from six years. It is the numbers for all prisoners in these six years, but the six years were not picked at random. Unless there was something special about the six years that were chosen, the sample is probably a representative sample. This condition is probably met.\n\nb.  The properties of a binomial experiment are met. There are 14,495 prisoners in this case. Check: The prisoners are all Aboriginals, so you are not mixing Aboriginal with non-Aboriginal prisoners. There are only two outcomes, either the prisoner dies or doesn't. The chance that one prisoner dies over another may not be constant, but if you consider all prisoners the same, then it may be close to the same probability. Thus the conditions for the binomial distribution are satisfied\n\nc.  The sampling distribution of $\\hat{p}$ can be approximated with a normal distributed. Check: In this case $p = 0.0027$ and $n = 14,495$. $n*p=39.1365\\ge5$ and $n*q=14455.86\\ge5$. So, the sampling distribution for $\\hat{p}$ is normally distributed.\n\n<!-- -->\n\n4.  Find the sample statistic, test statistic, and p-value\n\nUse the following command in rStudio:\n\n```{r prop-test6}\nprop.test(51, 14495, p=0.0027)\n```\n\nSample Proportion: $\\hat{p}=0.0035$\n\nTest Statistic: $\\chi^2=3.3085$\n\np-value: $p-value=0.06893$\n\n5.  Conclusion\n\nSince the $p-value\\ge0.05$, then fail to reject $H_o$.\n\n6.  Interpretation\n\nThere is not enough evidence to support that the proportion of deaths of Aboriginal prisoners is different from non-Aboriginal prisoners.\n\n### Example: Hypothesis Test for One Proportion\n\nA researcher who is studying the effects of income levels on breastfeeding of infants hypothesizes that countries with a low income level have a different rate of infant breastfeeding than higher income countries. It is known that in Germany, considered a high-income country by the World Bank, 22% of all babies are breastfeed. In Tajikistan, considered a low-income country by the World Bank, researchers found that in a random sample of 500 new mothers that 125 were breastfeeding their infant. At the 5% level of significance, does this show that low-income countries have a different incident of breastfeeding?\n\n#### Solution\n\n1.  State you random variable and the parameter in words.\n\n$x$ = number of woman who breastfeed in a low-income country\n\n$p$ = proportion of woman who breastfeed in a low-income country\n\n2.  State the null and alternative hypotheses and the level of significance\n\n$H_o:p=0.22$\n\n$H_a:p\\ne0.22$\n\n$\\alpha=0.05$\n\n3.  State and check the conditions for a hypothesis test\n\n<!-- -->\n\na.  A simple random sample of 500 breastfeeding habits of woman in a low-income country was taken. Check: This was stated in the problem.\n\nb.  The properties of a Binomial Experiment have been met. Check: There were 500 women in the study. The women are considered identical, though they probably have some differences. There are only two outcomes, either the woman breastfeeds or she doesn't. The probability of a woman breastfeeding is probably not the same for each woman, but it is probably not very different for each woman. The conditions for the binomial distribution are satisfied\n\nc.  The sampling distribution of $\\hat{p}$ can be approximated with a normal distributed. Check: In this case, $n = 500$ and $p = 0.22$. $n*p= 110\\ge5$ and $n*q=390\\ge5$, so the sampling distribution of $\\hat{p}$ is well approximated by a normal curve.\n\n<!-- -->\n\n4.  Find the sample statistic, test statistic, and p-value\n\nOn r studio, use the following command\n\n```{r prop-test6a}\nprop_test(125, 500, p=0.22) \n```\n\nSample Statistic: $\\hat{p}=0.25$\n\ntest Statistic: $\\chi^2=2.4505$\n\np-value: $p-value=0.1175$\n\n5.  Conclusion\n\nSince the p-value is more than 0.05, you fail to reject $H_o$.\n\n6.  Interpretation\n\nThere is not enough evidence to support that the proportion of women who breastfeed in low-income countries is different from the proportion of women in high-income countries who breastfeed.\n\nNotice, the conclusion is that there wasn't enough evidence to support $H_a$. The conclusion was not that you support $H_o$. There are many reasons why you can't say that $H_o$ is true. It could be that the countries you chose were not very representative of what truly happens. If you instead looked at all high-income countries and compared them to low-income countries, you might have different results. It could also be that the sample you collected in the low-income country was not representative. It could also be that income level is not an indication of breastfeeding habits. It could be that the sample that was taken didn't show evidence but another sample would show evidence. There could be other factors involved. This is why you can't say that you support $H_o$. There are too many other factors that could be the reason that you failed to reject $H_0$.\n\n### Homework for One-Sample Proportion Test Section\n\n**In each problem show all steps of the hypothesis test. If some of the conditions are not met, note that the results of the test may not be correct and then continue the process of the hypothesis test.**\n\n1.  The Arizona Republic/Morrison/Cronkite News poll published on Monday, October 20, 2016, found 390 of the registered voters surveyed favor Proposition 205, which would legalize marijuana for adults. The statewide telephone poll surveyed 779 registered voters between Oct. 10 and Oct. 15. (Sanchez, 2016) Fifty-five percent of Colorado residents supported the legalization of marijuana. Does the data provide evidence that the percentage of Arizona residents who support legalization of marijuana is different from the proportion of Colorado residents who support it. Test at the 1% level.\n\n2.  In July of 1997, Australians were asked if they thought unemployment would increase, and 47% thought that it would increase. In November of 1997, they were asked again. At that time 284 out of 631 said that they thought unemployment would increase (\\\\\"Morgan Gallup poll,\\\\\" 2013). At the 5% level, is there enough evidence to show that the proportion of Australians in November 1997 who believe unemployment would increase is different from the proportion who felt it would increase in July 1997?\n\n3.  According to the February 2008 Federal Trade Commission report on consumer fraud and identity theft, 23% of all complaints in 2007 were for identity theft. In that year, Arkansas had 1,601 complaints of identity theft out of 3,482 consumer complaints (\\\\\"Consumer fraud and,\\\\\" 2008). Does this data provide enough evidence to show that Arkansas had a different percentage of identity theft than 23%? Test at the 5% level.\n\n4.  According to the February 2008 Federal Trade Commission report on consumer fraud and identity theft, 23% of all complaints in 2007 were for identity theft. In that year, Alaska had 321 complaints of identity theft out of 1,432 consumer complaints (\\\\\"Consumer fraud and,\\\\\" 2008). Does this data provide enough evidence to show that Alaska had a different proportion of identity theft than 23%? Test at the 5% level.\n\n5.  In 2001, the Gallup poll found that 81% of American adults believed that there was a conspiracy in the death of President Kennedy. In 2013, the Gallup poll asked 1,039 American adults if they believe there was a conspiracy in the assassination, and found that 634 believe there was a conspiracy (\\\\\"Gallup news service,\\\\\" 2013). Do the data show that the proportion of Americans who believe in this conspiracy has changed? Test at the 1% level.\n\n6.  In 2008, there were 507 children in Arizona out of 32,601 who were diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) (\\\\\"Autism and developmental,\\\\\" 2008). Nationally 1 in 88 children are diagnosed with ASD (\\\\\"CDC features -,\\\\\" 2013). Is there sufficient data to show that the incident of ASD is different in Arizona than nationally? Test at the 1% level.\n\n## One-Sample Test for the Mean\n\nIt is time to go back to look at the test for the mean that was introduced in section 7.1 called the $z$-test. In the example, you knew what the population standard deviation, $\\sigma$, was. What if you don't know $\\sigma$?\n\nIf you don't know $\\sigma$, then you don't know the sampling distribution of the mean. Can it be found another way? The answer is of course, yes. One way is to use a method called resampling. The following example explains how resampling is performed.\n\n### Example: Resampling\n\nA random sample of 10 body mass index (BMI) were taken from the NHANES Data frame The mean BMI of Australians is 27.2 $kg/m^2$. Is there evidence that Americans have a different BMI from people in Australia. Test at the 5% level.\n\n#### Solution\n\nThe standard deviation of BMI is not known for Australians. To answer this questions, first look at the sample from NHANES @tbl-NHANES-10-sample.\n\n```{r NHANES-10-sample}\n#| tbl-alt: \"Sample of size 10 from NHANES data frame\"\n#| label: tbl-NHANES-10-sample\n#| tbl-cap: \"Sample of size 10 from NHANES\"\nsample_NHANES_10<- \n  NHANES |>\n  slice_sample(n=10)\nknitr::kable(head(sample_NHANES_10))\n```\n\nThe mean BMI from this sample is\n\n```{r NHANES-10-stats, warning=FALSE}\ndf_stats(~BMI, data=sample_NHANES_10, mean)\n```\n\nThe sample mean for Americans is different from the mean BMI for Australians, but could it just be by chance. Suppose you take another sample of size 10, but you only have these 10 BMIs to work with. So how could you do this. One way is to assume that the sample you took is representative of the entire population, and so you create a population by copying this sample over and over again. So you could have over 1000 copies of this sample of 10 BMIs. Then take a sample of size 10 from this created population. When doing this, you could conceivably choose the same number several times that was in the original sample and not choose some of the numbers that were in the original sample. Instead of physically creating this new population, you could just take samples from your original sample but with replacement. This means that you randomly pick the first number, record it, and then put it back that value back before collecting the next number. This kind a sampling is called **randomization sampling**. A sample using randomization could be @tbl-NHANES-10-resample.\n\n```{r sample_NHANES_10-resample}\n#| tbl-alt: \"Resamling from HNANES sample\"\n#| label: tbl-NHANES-10-resample\n#| tbl-cap: \"Resample from NHANES Sample\"\nknitr::kable(resample(sample_NHANES_10))\n```\n\nNotice that some of the unit of observations are repeated. That is what happens when you resample. Now one resampling isn't enough. So you want to resample many times so you can create a resampling distribution @fig-NHANES-10-resample-histogram\n\n```{r sample-NHANES10-resample-histogram}\n#| fig-alt: \"Resampling distribution of mean BMI with sample size 10, and measured sample mean.\"\n#| label: fig-NHANES-10-resample-histogram\n#| fig-cap: \"Resampling distribution of mean BMI with sample size 10\"\n#| warning: FALSE\n# mutate NHANES to subtract 27.2 (Australia's BMI) from US BMI measurements \nmutate_NHANES <- NHANES |>\n  mutate(NewBMI=BMI-27.2)\n# Generate the single sample\nSingle_sample<- mutate_NHANES |>\n  sample_n(size = 10)\n#Calculate the mean age of the single sample \nSingle_sample_mean <- \n  Single_sample |>\n  df_stats( ~ NewBMI, means = mean)\n#Take 200 resamples from the single sample\nTrials_resample <- \n  do(200) * { Single_sample |>\n      resample() |>\n      df_stats( ~ NewBMI, means = mean) }\n# Plot the resample distribution of means\ngf_density( ~ means, data = Trials_resample, bins = 10) |>\n  gf_lims(x = c(-5, 10)) |>\n  gf_labs(title = \"Resampling Distribution\") |>\n  gf_vline(data = Single_sample_mean, xintercept = ~ means, color=\"red\")\ndf_stats( ~ means, data = Trials_resample, mean, sd)\n```\n\nNotice the sample mean from the resampling is very close to 0, so that means that the US BMI are not that different from the Australian BMI. There doesn't seem to be enough evidence to show that the US BMI is different from the Australian BMI. One note, the sample size used here was 10 so you could see the sample, but really the sample size should be more than 100 for this method to be valid.\n\nSo this is one way to answer the question about if there is evidence to show a population mean is different from a value. This is actually the method that Ronald Fisher developed when he create all the foundation work that he did in statistics in the early 1900s. However, at the time, computers didn't exist, so taking 100 resampling samples was not possible at that time. So other methods had to be developed that could be computed during that time. One method was developed by William (W.S) Gossett, a Chemist who worked for Guinness as their head brewer. Gossett developed a distribution called the Student's T-distribution. His process was to use the sample standard deviation, $s$, as an approximation of $\\sigma$. This means the test statistic is now $t=\\frac{x-\\mu}{\\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}}$. This new test statistic is actually distributed as a Student's t-distribution, developed by W.S. Gossett. There are some conditions that must be made for this formula to be a Student's t-distribution. These are outlined in the following theorem. Note: the t-distribution is called the Student's t-distribution because that is the name he published under because he couldn't publish under his own name due to his employer not wanting him to publish under his own name. His employer by the way was Guinness and they didn't want competitors knowing they had a chemist/statistician working for them. It is not called the Student's t-distribution because it is only used by students.\n\nTheorem: If the following conditions are met\n\na.  A random sample of size $n$ is taken.\n\nb.  The distribution of the random variable is normal.\n\nThen the distribution of is a Student's t-distribution with $n-1$ degrees of freedom.\n\n**Explanation of degrees of freedom**: Recall the formula for sample standard deviation is $\\sqrt{{\\frac{\\sum{x-\\bar{x}}}{n-1}}}$. Notice the denominator is $n-1$. This is the same as the degrees of freedom. This is no accident. The reason the denominator and the degrees of freedom are both comes from how the standard deviation is calculated. First you take each data value and subtract $\\bar{x}$. If you add up all of these new values, you will get 0. This must happen. Since it must happen, the first $n-1$ data values you have \"freedom of choice\", but the nth data value, you have no freedom to choose. Hence, you have $n-1$ degrees of freedom. Another way to think about it is that if you five people and five chairs, the first four people have a choice of where they are sitting, but the last person does not. They have no freedom of where to sit. Only $n-1$ people have freedom of choice.\n\nThe Student's t-distribution is bell-shape that is more spread out than the normal distribution. There are many $t$-distributions, one for each different degree of freedom.\n\n@fig-tdistribution-graph is of the normal distribution and the Student's t-distribution for df = 1, df = 3, df=8, df=30.\n\n```{r tdistribution-graph}\n#| fig-alt: \"Student t distributions with different degrees of freedom and normal curve.\"\n#| label: fig-tdistribution-graph\n#| echo: FALSE\n#| fig-cap: \"Typical Student t-Distributions\"\nx <- seq(-4, 4, length=100) \nhx <- dnorm(x)\ndegf <- c(1, 3, 8, 30) \ncolors <- c(\"red\", \"blue\", \"darkgreen\", \"gold\", \"black\") \nlabels <- c(\"df=1\", \"df=3\", \"df=8\", \"df=30\", \"normal\")\nplot(x, hx, type=\"l\", lty=2, xlab=\"x value\", ylab=\"Density\", main=\"Comparison of t Distributions\")\nfor (i in 1:4){ lines(x, dt(x,degf[i]), lwd=2, col=colors[i]) }\nlegend(\"topright\", inset=.05, title=\"Distributions\", \n       labels, lwd=2, lty=c(1, 1, 1, 1, 2), col=colors) \n```\n\nAs the degrees of freedom increases, the student's t-distribution looks more like the normal distribution.\n\nTo find probabilities for the t-distribution, again technology can do this for you. There are many technologies out there that you can use.\n\n### **Hypothesis Test for One Population Mean (t-Test)**\n\n1.  State the random variable and the parameter in words.\n\n$x$ = random variable\n\n$\\mu$ = mean of random variable\n\n2.  State the null and alternative hypotheses and the level of significance\n\n$H_o:\\mu=\\mu_o$ , where $\\mu_o$ is the known mean\n\n$H_a:\\mu\\ne\\mu_o$, you can also use \\< or \\>, but $\\ne$ is the more modern one to use.\n\nAlso, state your $\\alpha$ level here.\n\n3.  State and check the conditions for a hypothesis test\n\n<!-- -->\n\na.  State: A random sample of size $n$ is taken. Check: Describe the process taken to collect the sample.\n\nb.  State: The population of the random variable is normally distributed. Check: examine density graph and normal quantile plot. Note: The t-test is fairly robust to the condition if the sample size is large. This means that if this condition isn't met, but your sample size is quite large, then the results of the t-test are valid.\n\n<!-- -->\n\n4.  Find the sample statistic, test statistic, and p-value\n\nOn rStudio, the command is\n\nt.test(\\~variable, data=data_frame, mu=what_Ho_says)\n\n5.  Conclusion\n\nThis is where you write reject or fail to reject $H_o$. The rule is: if the p-value $<\\alpha$, then reject $H_o$. If the p-value $\\ge \\alpha$, then fail to reject $H_o$\n\n6.  Interpretation\n\nThis is where you interpret in real world terms the conclusion to the test. The conclusion for a hypothesis test is that you either have enough evidence to support $H_a$, or you do not have enough evidence to support $H_a$.\n\nNote: if the conditions behind this test are not valid, then the conclusions you make from the test are not valid. If you do not have a random sample, that is your fault. Make sure the sample you take is as random as you can make it following sampling techniques from chapter 1. If the population of the random variable is not normal, then take a larger sample. If you cannot afford to do that, or if it is not logistically possible, then you do different tests called non-parametric tests or you can try resampling. The advantage fo resampling is that you don't need to know the under laying distribution of the random variable.\n\n### Example: Test of the Mean Using One Sample T-test\n\nA random sample of 50 body mass index (BMI) were taken from the NHANES Data frame @tbl-sample_NHANES_50. The mean BMI of Australians is 27.2 $kg/m^2$. Is there evidence that Americans have a different BMI from people in Australia. Test at the 5% level.\n\n```{r sample_NHANES-50-data}\n#| tbl-alt: \"Head of BMI of Americans\"\n#| label: tbl-sample_NHANES_50\n#| tbl-cap: \"BMI of Americans\"\nsample_NHANES_50<- sample_n(NHANES, size=50) \nknitr::kable(head(sample_NHANES_50))\n```\n\n#### **Solution**\n\n1.  State the random variable and the parameter in words.\n\n$x$ = BMI of an American\n\n$\\mu$ = mean BMI of Americans\n\n2.  State the null and alternative hypotheses and the level of significance\n\n$H_o:\\mu=27.2$\n\n$H_a:\\mu\\ne 27.2$\n\nlevel of significance $\\alpha=0.05$\n\n3.  State and check the conditions for a hypothesis test\n\n<!-- -->\n\na.  A random sample of 50 BMI levels was taken. Check: A random sample was taken from the NHANES data frame using r Studio\n\nb.  The population of BMI levels is normally distributed. Check:\n\n(ref:sample-NHANES-50-density-cap) Density Plot of BMI from NHANES sample\n\n```{r sample-NHANES-50-density}\n#| fig-alt: \"Density plot of BMI. Slightly right skewed\"\n#| warning: FALSE\n#| label: fig-sample-NHANES-50-density\n#| fig-cap: \"Density Plot of BMI from NHANES sample\"\ngf_density(~BMI, data=sample_NHANES_50, title=\"Body Mass Index\", xlab=\"Body Mass Index\")\ngf_qq(~BMI, data=sample_NHANES_50, title=\"Body Mass Index\", xlab=\"Body Mass Index\")\n```\n\nThe density plot looks somewhat skewed right and the normal quantile plot looks somewhat linear. However, there doesn't seem to be strong evidence that the sample comes from a population that is normally distributed. However, since the sample is moderate to large, the $t$-test is robust to this condition not being met. So the results of the test are probably valid.\n\n4.  Find the sample statistic, test statistic, and $p$-value\n\nOn rStudio, the command would be\n\n```{r, t-test-NHANES-50}\nt.test(~BMI, data= sample_NHANES_50, mu=27.2) \n```\n\nThe test statistic is the $t$ in the output, the sample statistic is the mean of $x$ in the output, and the $p$-value is the $p$-value is the output.\n\n5.  Conclusion\n\nSince the $p$-value is not less than 5%, then fail to reject $H_o$.\n\n6.  Interpretation\n\nThere is not enough evidence to support that Americans have a different BMI from Australians.\n\nNote: this is the same conclusion that was found when using resampling. So the two method could give similar conclusions.\n\n### Example: Test of the Mean Using One Sample T-test\n\nIn 2011, the average life expectancy for a woman in Europe was 79.8 years. The data in @tbl-Expectancy are the life expectancies for all people in European countries (\\\\\"WHO life expectancy,\" 2013).

Water samples were collected from the surface of the middle of each lake in August 1990 and then again in March 1991. The pH level, the amount of chlorophyll, calcium, and alkalinity were measured in each sample. The average of the August and March values were used in the analysis. Next, a sample of fish was taken from each lake with sample sizes ranging from 4 to 44 fish. The age of each fish and mercury concentration in the muscle tissue was measured. (Note: Since fish absorb mercury over time, older fish will tend to have higher concentrations). Thus, to make a fair comparison of the fish in different lakes, the investigators used a regression estimate of the expected mercury concentration in a three year old fish as the standardized value for each lake. Finally, in 10 of the 53 lakes, the age of the individual fish could not be determined and the average mercury concentration of the sampled fish was used instead of the standardized value.

There are two branches of inferential statistics: hypothesis testing and confidence intervals.\n\n**Hypothesis Testing**: making a decision about a parameter(s) based on a statistic(s).\n\n**Confidence Interval**: estimating a parameter(s) based on a statistic(s).\n\nThis chapter will describe hypothesis testing, but as was stated in Chapter 1, the American Statistical Association (ASA) is suggesting not discussing statistical significance and p-values. So this chapter is mostly for background to understand previously published studies.\n\n## Basics of Hypothesis Testing\n\nTo understand the process of a hypothesis tests, you need to first have an understanding of what a hypothesis is, which is an educated guess about a parameter. Once you have the hypothesis, you collect data and use the data to make a determination to see if there is enough evidence to show that the hypothesis is true. However, in hypothesis testing you actually assume something else is true, and then you look at your data to see how likely it is to get an event that your data demonstrates with that assumption. If the event is very unusual, then you might think that your assumption is actually false. If you are able to say this assumption is false, then your hypothesis must be true. This is known as a proof by contradiction. You assume the opposite of your hypothesis is true and show that it can't be true. If this happens, then your hypothesis must be true. All hypothesis tests go through the same process. Once you have the process down, then the concept is much easier. It is easier to see the process by looking at an example. Concepts that are needed will be detailed in this example.\n\n### Example: Basics of Hypothesis Testing\n\nSuppose a manufacturer of the XJ35 battery claims the mean life of the battery is 500 days with a standard deviation of 25 days. You are the buyer of this battery and you think this claim is incorrect. You would like to test your belief because without a good reason you can't get out of your contract.\n\n#### **Solution**\n\nWhat do you do?\n\nWell first, you should know what you are trying to measure. Define the random variable.\n\nLet $x$ = life of a XJ35 battery\n\nNow you are not just trying to find different \\$x\\$ values. You are trying to find what the true mean is. Since you are trying to find it, it must be unknown. You don't think it is 500 days. If you did, you wouldn't be doing any testing. The true mean, $\\mu$, is unknown. That means you should define that too.\n\nLet $\\mu$ = mean life of a XJ35 battery\n\nNow what?\n\nYou may want to collect a sample. What kind of sample?\n\nYou could ask the manufacturers to give you batteries, but there is a chance that there could be some bias in the batteries they pick. To reduce the chance of bias, it is best to take a random sample.\n\nHow big should the sample be?\n\nA sample of size 30 or more means that you can use the central limit theorem. Pick a sample of size 50.\n\n@tbl-Battery contains the data for the sample you collected:\n\n```{r battery-data}\n#| tbl-alt: \"Head of Data on Battery Life\"\n#| label: tbl-Battery\n#| tbl-cap: \"Data on Battery Life\"\nBattery<- read.csv( \"https://krkozak.github.io/MAT160/battery.csv\") \nknitr::kable(head(Battery))\n```\n\nNow what should you do? Looking at the data set, you see some of the times are above 500 and some are below. But looking at all of the numbers is too difficult. It might be helpful to calculate the mean for this sample.\n\n```{r battery-data-stats}\ndf_stats(~life, data=Battery, mean)\n```\n\nThe sample mean is 491.42 days. Looking at the sample mean, one might think that you are right. However, the standard deviation and the sample size also plays a role, so maybe you are wrong.\n\nBefore going any farther, it is time to formalize a few definitions.\n\nYou have a guess that the mean life of a battery is not 500 days. This is opposed to what the manufacturer claims. There really are two hypotheses, which are just guesses here --- the one that the manufacturer claims and the one that you believe. It is helpful to have names for them.\n\n**Null Hypothesis**: historical value, claim, or product specification. The symbol used is $H_o$.\n\n**Alternate Hypothesis**: what you want to prove. This is what you want to accept as true when you reject the null hypothesis. There are two symbols that are commonly used for the alternative hypothesis: $H_a$ or $H_1$. The symbol $H_a$ will be used in this book.\n\nIn general, the hypotheses look something like this:\n\n$H_0:\\mu=\\mu_o$\n\n$H_a:\\mu\\ne \\mu_o$\n\nwhere $\\mu_o$ just represents the value that the claim says the population mean is actually equal to.\n\nAlso, $H_a$ can be less than, greater than, or not equal to, though not equal to is more common these days.\n\nFor this problem:\n\n$H_o:\\mu=500\\text{ days}$, since the manufacturer says the mean life of a battery is 500 days.\n\n$H_a:\\mu\\ne 500\\text{ days}$, since you believe that the mean life of the battery is not 500 days.\n\nNow back to the mean. You have a sample mean of 491.42 days. Is this different enough to believe that you are right and the manufacturer is wrong? How different does it have to be?\n\nIf you calculated a sample mean of 235 or 690, you would definitely believe the population mean is not 500. But even if you had a sample mean of 435 or 575 you would probably believe that the true mean was not 500. What about 475? or 535? Or 483? or 514? There is some point where you would stop being so sure that the population mean is not 500. That point separates the values of where you are sure or pretty sure that the mean is not 500 from the area where you are not so sure. How do you find that point?\n\nWell it depends on how much error you want to make. Of course you don't want to make any errors, but unfortunately that is unavoidable in statistics. You need to figure out how much error you made with your sample. Take the sample mean, and find the probability of getting another sample mean less than it, assuming for the moment that the manufacturer is right. The idea behind this is that you want to know what is the chance that you could have come up with your sample mean even if the population mean really is 500 days.\n\nChances are probabilities. So you want to find the probability that the sample mean of 491.42 is unusual given that the population mean is really 500 days. To compute this probability, you need to know how the sample mean is distributed. Since the sample size is at least 30, then you know the sample mean is approximately normally distributed. Now, you want to find the $z$-value. The $z$-value is $z=\\frac{491.42-500}{\\frac{25}{\\sqrt{50}}}=-2.43$.\n\nThis is more than 2 standard deviations below the mean, so that seems that the sample mean is usual. It might be helpful to find the probability though. Since you are saying that the sample mean is different from 500 days, then you are asking if it is greater than or less than. This means that you are in the tails of the normal curve. So the probability you want to find is the probability being more than 2.43 or less than $-2.43$. This is $P(-2.43<z)+P(z>2.43)=0.015$\n\n```{r pnorm6}\npnorm(-2.43, 0, 1, lower.tail=TRUE)+pnorm(2.43, 0, 1, lower.tail=FALSE) \n```\n\nSo the probability of being in the tails is 0.015. This probability is known as a p-value for probability-value. This is unusual, so it is unlikely to get a sample mean of 491.42 if the population mean is 500 days.\n\nSo it appears the assumption that the population mean is 500 days is wrong, and you can reject the manufacturer's claim.\n\nBut how do you quantify really small? Is 5% or 10% or 15% really small? How do you decide?\n\nBefore you answer that question, a couple more definitions are needed.\n\n**Test statistic**: $z=\\frac{\\bar{x}-\\mu_o}{\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}}$ since it is calculated as part of the testing of the hypothesis\n\n**p - value**: probability that the test statistic will take on more extreme values than the observed test statistic, given that the null hypothesis is true. It is the probability that was calculated above.\n\nNow, how small is small enough? To answer that, you really want to know the types of errors you can make.\n\nThere are actually only two errors that can be made. The first error is if you say that is false, when in fact it is true. This means you reject when was true. The second error is if you say that is true, when in fact it is false. This means you fail to reject when is false. The following table organizes this for you:\n\n### Type of errors:\n\n|                   | Ho true      | Ho false      |\n|-------------------|--------------|---------------|\n| Reject Ho         | Type I error | no error      |\n| Fail to reject Ho | no error     | Type II error |\n\n: Type of errors\n\nThus\n\n**Type I Error** is rejecting $H_o$ when $H_o$ is true, and\n\n**Type II Error** is failing to reject $H_o$ when is $H_o$ false.\n\nSince these are the errors, then one can define the probabilities attached to each error.\n\n$\\alpha$= P(type I error) = P(rejecting\\$H_o\\$ given it is true)\n\n$\\beta$= P(type II error) = P(failing to reject\\$H_o\\$ given it is false)\n\n$\\alpha$ is also called the **level of significance**.\n\nAnother common concept that is used is Power = $1-\\beta$\n\nNow there is a relationship between $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$. They are not complements of each other. How are they related?\n\nIf $\\alpha$ increases that means the chances of making a type I error will increase. It is more likely that a type I error will occur. It makes sense that you are less likely to make type II errors, only because you will be rejecting more often. You will be failing to reject less, and therefore, the chance of making a type II error will decrease. Thus, as $\\alpha$ increases, $\\beta$ will decrease, and vice versa. That makes them seem like complements, but they aren't complements. What gives? Consider one more factor \\-- sample size.\n\nConsider if you have a larger sample that is representative of the population, then it makes sense that you have more accuracy then with a smaller sample. Think of it this way, which would you trust more, a sample mean of 490 if you had a sample size of 35 or sample size of 350 (assuming a representative sample)? Of course the 350 because there are more data points and so more accuracy. If you are more accurate, then there is less chance that you will make any error. By increasing the sample size of a representative sample, you decrease both $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$.\n\nSummary of all of this:\n\n1.  For a certain sample size, $\\alpha$ increases, $\\beta$ decreases.\n\n2.  For a certain level of significance, $\\alpha$, if $n$ increases, $\\beta$ decreases.\n\nNow how do you find $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$? Well $\\alpha$ is actually chosen. There are only two values that are usually picked for $\\alpha$: 0.01 and 0.05. is very difficult to find $\\beta$, so usually it isn't found. If you want to make sure it is small you take as large of a sample as you can afford provided it is a representative sample. This is one use of the Power. You want to be small and the Power of the test is large. The Power word sounds good.\n\nWhich pick of $\\alpha$ do you pick? Well that depends on what you are working on. Remember in this example you are the buyer who is trying to get out of a contract to buy these batteries. If you create a type I error, you said that the batteries are bad when they aren't, most likely the manufacturer will sue you. You want to avoid this. You might pick $\\alpha$ to be 0.01. This way you have a small chance of making a type I error. Of course this means you have more of a chance of making a type II error. No big deal right? What if the batteries are used in pacemakers and you tell the person that their pacemaker's batteries are good for 500 days when they actually last less, that might be bad. If you make a type II error, you say that the batteries do last 500 days when they last less, then you have the possibility of killing someone. You certainly do not want to do this. In this case you might want to pick $\\alpha$ as 0.05. If both errors are equally bad, then pick $\\alpha$ as 0.05.\n\nThe above discussion is why the choice of depends on what you are researching. As the researcher, you are the one that needs to decide what level to use based on your analysis of the consequences of making each error is.\n\nIf a type I error is really bad, then pick $\\alpha$= 0.01.\n\nIf a type II error is really bad, then pick $\\alpha$= 0.05\n\nIf neither error is bad, or both are equally bad, then pick $\\alpha$ = 0.05\n\nUsually $\\alpha$ is picked to be 0.05 in most cases.\n\nThe main thing is to always pick the $\\alpha$ before you collect the data and start the test.\n\nThe above discussion was long, but it is really important information. If you don't know what the errors of the test are about, then there really is no point in making conclusions with the tests. Make sure you understand what the two errors are and what the probabilities are for them.\n\nNow it is time to go back to the example and put this all together. This is the basic structure of testing a hypothesis, usually called a hypothesis test. Since this one has a test statistic involving $z$, it is also called a $z$-test. And since there is only one sample, it is usually called a one-sample $z$-test.\n\n### Example: Battery Example Revisited.\n\nSteps of a hypothesis test:\n\n1.  State the random variable and the parameter in words\n2.  State the null and alternative hypothesis and the level of significance\n3.  State and check the conditions for a hypothesis test\n4.  Find the sample statistic, test statistic, and p-value\n5.  Conclusion:\n6.  Interpretation:\n\n#### Solution\n\n1.  State the random variable and the parameter in words\n\n$x$ = life of battery\n\n$\\mu$ = mean life of a XJ35 battery\n\n2.  State the null and alternative hypothesis and the level of significance\n\n$H_o:\\mu=500$\n\n$H_a:\\mu\\ne500$\n\n$\\alpha$ = 0.05 (from above discussion about consequences)\n\n3.  State and check the conditions for a hypothesis test\n\nEvery hypothesis has some conditions that be met to make sure that the results of the hypothesis are valid. The conditions are different for each test. This test has the following conditions.\n\na.  A random sample of size $n$ is taken.\n\nThis occurred in this example, since it was stated that a random sample of 50 battery lives were taken.\n\nb.  The population standard deviation is known.\n\nThis is true, since it was given in the problem.\n\nc.  The sample size is at least 30 or the population of the random variable is normally distributed.\n\nThe sample size was 30, so this condition is met.\n\n4.  Find the sample statistic, test statistic, and p-value\n\nThe test statistic depends on how many samples there are, what parameter you are testing, and conditions that need to be checked. In this case, there is one sample and you are testing the mean. The conditions were checked above.\n\nSample statistic:\n\n```{r battery-stats}\ndf_stats(~life, data=Battery, mean)\n```\n\nTest statistic: The z-value is $z=\\frac{491.42-400}{\\frac{25}{\\sqrt{n}}}=-2.43$.\n\np-value: $P(-2.43<z)+P(z>2.43)=0.015$\n\n5.  Conclusion:\n\nNow what? Well, this p-value is 0.015. This is a lot smaller than the amount of error you would accept in the problem $\\alpha$ = 0.05. That means that finding a sample mean less than 490 days is unusual to happen if is true. This should make you think that is not true. You should reject $H_o$.\n\nIn fact, in general:\n\nReject $H_o$ if the p-value $<\\alpha$\n\nFail to reject $H_o$ if the p-value $\\ge\\alpha$.\n\n6.  Interpretation:\n\nSince you rejected $H_o$, what does this mean in the real world? That it what goes in the interpretation. Since you rejected the claim by the manufacturer that the mean life of the batteries is 500 days, then you now can believe that your hypothesis was correct. In other words, there is enough evidence to support that the mean life of the battery is less than 500 days.\n\nNow that you know that the batteries last less than 500 days, should you cancel the contract? Statistically, there is evidence that the batteries do not last as long as the manufacturer says they should. However, based on this sample there are only ten days less on average that the batteries last. There may not be practical significance in this case. Ten days do not seem like a large difference. In reality, if the batteries are used in pacemakers, then you would probably tell the patient to have the batteries replaced every year. You have a large buffer whether the batteries last 490 days or 500 days. It seems that it might not be worth it to break the contract over ten days. What if the 10 days was practically significant? Are there any other things you should consider? You might look at the business relationship with the manufacturer. You might also look at how much it would cost to find a new manufacturer. These are also questions to consider before making any changes. What this discussion should show you is that just because a hypothesis has statistical significance does not mean it has practical significance. The hypothesis test is just one part of a research process. There are other pieces that you need to consider.\n\nThat's it. That is what a hypothesis test looks like. All hypothesis tests are done with the same six steps. Those general six steps are outlined below.\n\n### Steps for hypothesis test\n\n1.  State the random variable and the parameter in words. This is where you are defining what the unknowns are in this problem.\n\n$x$ = random variable\n\n$\\mu$ = mean of random variable, if the parameter of interest is the mean. There are other parameters you can test, and you would use the appropriate symbol for that parameter.\n\n2.  State the null and alternative hypotheses and the level of significance\n\n$H_o:\\mu=\\mu_o$, where $\\mu_o$ is the known mean\n\n$H_a:\\mu\\ne\\mu_o$, You can replace $\\ne$ with $<$ or $>$ but usually you use $\\ne$\n\nAlso, state your level here.\n\n3.  State and check the conditions for a hypothesis test\n\nEach hypothesis test has its own conditions. They will be stated when the different hypothesis tests are discussed.\n\n4.  Find the sample statistic, test statistic, and p-value\n\nThis depends on what parameter you are working with, how many samples, and the conditions of the test. Technology will be used to find the sample statistic, test statistic, and p-value.\n\n5.  Conclusion\n\nThis is where you write reject $H_o$ or fail to reject $H_o$. The rule is: if the p-value $<\\alpha$, then reject $H_o$. If the p-value $\\ge\\alpha$, then fail to reject $H_o$\n\n6.  Interpretation\n\nThis is where you interpret in real world terms the conclusion to the test. The conclusion for a hypothesis test is that you either have enough evidence to support $H_a$, or you do not have enough evidence to support $H_a$.\n\nSorry, one more concept about the conclusion and interpretation. First, the conclusion is that you reject or you fail to reject \\$H_o\\$. Why was it said like this? It is because you never accept the null hypothesis. If you wanted to accept the null hypothesis, then why do the test in the first place? In the interpretation, you either have enough evidence to support $H_a$, or you do not have enough evidence to support $H_a$. You wouldn't want to go to all this work and then find out you wanted to accept the claim. Why go through the trouble? You always want to have enough evidence to support the alternative hypothesis. Sometimes you can do that and sometimes you can't. If you don't have enough evidence to support $H_a$, it doesn't mean you support the null hypothesis; it just means you can't support the alternative hypothesis. Here is an example to demonstrate this.\n\n### Example: Conclusions in Hypothesis Tests\n\nIn the U.S. court system a jury trial could be set up as a hypothesis test. To really help you see how this works, let's use OJ Simpson as an example. In the court system, a person is presumed innocent until he/she is proven guilty, and this is your null hypothesis. OJ Simpson was a football player in the 1970s. In 1994 his ex-wife and her friend were killed. OJ Simpson was accused of the crime, and in 1995 the case was tried. The prosecutors wanted to prove OJ was guilty of killing his wife and her friend, and that is the alternative hypothesis. In this case, a verdict of not guilty was given. That does not mean that he is innocent of this crime. It means there was not enough evidence to prove he was guilty. Many people believe that OJ was guilty of this crime, but the jury did not feel that the evidence presented was enough to show there was guilt. The verdict in a jury trial is always guilty or not guilty!\n\nThe same is true in a hypothesis test. There is either enough or not enough evidence to support the alternative hypothesis. It is not that you proved the null hypothesis true.\n\nWhen identifying hypothesis, it is important to state your random variable and the appropriate parameter you want to make a decision about. If you count something, then the random variable is the number of whatever you counted. The parameter is the proportion of what you counted. If the random variable is something you measured, then the parameter is the mean of what you measured. (Note: there are other parameters you can calculate, and some analysis of those will be presented in later chapters.)\n\n### Example: Stating Hypotheses\n\nIdentify the hypotheses necessary to test the following statements:\n\na.  The average salary of a teacher is different from \\\\\\$30,000.\nb.  The proportion of students who like math is not 10%.\nc.  The average age of students in this class differs from 21.\n\n#### **Solution**\n\na.  The average salary of a teacher is different from \\\\\\$30,000.\n\n$x$ = salary of teacher\n\n$\\mu=$ mean salary of teacher\n\nThe guess is that $\\mu\\ne30000$ and that is the alternative hypothesis.\n\nThe null hypothesis has the same parameter and number with an equal sign.\n\n$H_o:\\mu=30000$ $H_a:\\mu\\ne30000$\n\nb.  The proportion of students who like math is not 10%.\n\n$x$ = number of students who like math\n\n$p$ = proportion of students who like math\n\nThe guess is that $p$ is not 0.10 and that is the alternative hypothesis. $H_a:p\\ne0.10$ and the null hypothesis would be $H_o:p=0.10$\n\nc.  The average age of students in this class differs from 21.\n\n$x$ = age of students in this class\n\n$\\mu$=mean age of students in this class\n\nThe guess is that $\\mu\\ne21$ and that is the alternative hypothesis. $H_a:\\mu\\ne21$ and the null hypothesis would be $H_o: \\mu=21$\n\n### Example: Stating Type I and II Errors and Picking Level of Significance\n\na.  The plant-breeding department at a major university developed a new hybrid raspberry plant called YumYum Berry. Based on research data, the claim is made that from the time shoots are planted 90 days on average are required to obtain the first berry with a standard deviation of 9.2 days. A corporation that is interested in marketing the product tests 60 shoots by planting them and recording the number of days before each plant produces its first berry. The sample mean is 92.3 days. The corporation wants to know if the mean number of days is more than the 90 days claimed. State the type I and type II errors in terms of this problem, consequences of each error, and state which level of significance to use.\nb.  A concern was raised in Australia that the percentage of deaths of Aboriginal prisoners was higher than the percent of deaths of non-indigenous prisoners, which is 0.27%. State the type I and type II errors in terms of this problem, consequences of each error, and state which level of significance to use.\n\n#### **Solution**\n\na.  The plant-breeding department at a major university developed a new hybrid raspberry plant called YumYum Berry. Based on research data, the claim is made that from the time shoots are planted 90 days on average are required to obtain the first berry with a standard deviation of 9.2 days. A corporation that is interested in marketing the product tests 60 shoots by planting them and recording the number of days before each plant produces its first berry. The sample mean is 92.3 days.

State the type I and type II errors in terms of this problem, consequences of each error, and state which level of significance to use.\n\n$x$ = time to first berry for YumYum Berry plant\n\n$\\mu$= mean time to first berry for YumYum Berry plant\n\nType I Error: If the corporation does a type I error, then they will say that the plants take longer to produce than 90 days when they don't. They probably will not want to market the plants if they think they will take longer. They will not market them even though in reality the plants do produce in 90 days. They may have loss of future earnings, but that is all.\n\nType II error: The corporation do not say that the plants take longer then 90 days to produce when they do take longer. Most likely they will market the plants. The plants will take longer, and so customers might get upset and then the company would get a bad reputation. This would be really bad for the company.\n\nLevel of significance: It appears that the corporation would not want to make a type II error. Pick a 5% level of significance, $\\alpha=0.05$.\n\nb.  A concern was raised in Australia that the percentage of deaths of Aboriginal prisoners was higher than the percent of deaths of non-indigenous prisoners, which is 0.27%. State the type I and type II errors in terms of this problem, consequences of each error, and state which level of significance to use.\n\n$x$ = number of Aboriginal prisoners who have died\n\n$p$ = proportion of Aboriginal prisoners who have died\n\nType I error: Rejecting that the proportion of Aboriginal prisoners who died was 0.27%, when in fact it was 0.27%. This would mean you would say there is a problem when there isn't one. You could anger the Aboriginal community, and spend time and energy researching something that isn't a problem.\n\nType II error: Failing to reject that the proportion of Aboriginal prisoners who died was 0.27%, when in fact it is higher than 0.27%. This would mean that you wouldn't think there was a problem with Aboriginal prisoners dying when there really is a problem. You risk causing deaths when there could be a way to avoid them.\n\nLevel of significance: It appears that both errors may be issues in this case. You wouldn't want to anger the Aboriginal community when there isn't an issue, and you wouldn't want people to die when there may be a way to stop it. It may be best to pick a 5% level of significance, $\\alpha=0.05$.\n\nHint \\-- hypothesis testing is really easy if you follow the same recipe every time. The only differences in the various problems are the conditions of the test and the test statistic you calculate so you can find the p-value. Do the same steps, in the same order, with the same words, every time and these problems become very easy.\n\n### Homework for Basics of Hypothesis Testing Section\n\n**For the problems in this section, a question is being asked. This is to help you understand what the hypotheses are. You are not to run any hypothesis tests nor come up with any conclusions in this section.**\n\n1.

State why you picked this alpha level.\n\n## One-Sample Proportion Test\n\nThere are many different parameters that you can test. There is a test for the mean, such as was introduced with the \\$z\\$-test. There is also a test for the population proportion, $p$. This is where you might be curious if the proportion of students who smoke at your school is lower than the proportion in your area. Or you could question if the proportion of accidents caused by teenage drivers who do not have a drivers' education class is more than the national proportion.\n\nTo test a population proportion, there are a few things that need to be defined first. Usually, Greek letters are used for parameters and Latin letters for statistics. When talking about proportions, it makes sense to use $p$ for proportion. The Greek letter for $p$ is $\\pi$, but that is too confusing to use. Instead, it is best to use $p$ for the population proportion. That means that a different symbol is needed for the sample proportion. The convention is to use, $\\hat{p}$, known as p-hat. This way you know that $p$ is the population proportion, and that $\\hat{p}$ is the sample proportion related to it.\n\nNow proportion tests are about looking for the percentage of individuals who have a particular attribute. You are really looking for the number of successes that happen. Thus, a proportion test involves a binomial distribution.\n\n### **Hypothesis Test for One Population Proportion (1-Prop Test)**\n\n1.  State the random variable and the parameter in words.\n\n$x$ = number of successes\n\n$p$ = proportion of successes\n\n2.  State the null and alternative hypotheses and the level of significance\n\n$H_o:p=p_o$, where $p_o$ is the known proportion\n\n$H_a:p\\ne p_o$, you can also use \\< or \\>, but $\\ne$ is the more common one to use.\n\nAlso, state your $\\alpha$ level here.\n\n3.  State and check the conditions for a hypothesis test\n\n<!-- -->\n\na.  State: A simple random sample of size $n$ is taken. Check: describe how the sample was collected\n\nb.  State: The conditions for the binomial experiment are satisfied. Check: Show all four properties are true.\n\nc.  State: The sampling distribution of $\\hat{p}$ is normally distributed. Check: you need to show that $p*n\\ge5$ and $q*n\\ge5$, where $q=1-p$. If this requirement is true, then the sampling distribution of $\\hat{p}$ is well approximated by a normal curve.\n\n<!-- -->\n\n4.  Find the sample statistic, test statistic, and p-value\n\nThis will be computed on r Studio using the command\n\nprop.test(r, n, p=what_Ho_says)\n\nwhere $r$=observed number of successes and $n$ = number of trials.\n\n5.  Conclusion\n\nThis is where you write reject or fail to reject $H_o$. The rule is: if the p-value $<\\alpha$, then reject $H_0$. If the p-value $\\ge\\alpha$, then fail to reject $H_o$\n\n6.  Interpretation\n\nThis is where you interpret in real world terms the conclusion to the test. The conclusion for a hypothesis test is that you either have enough evidence to support $H_a$, or you do not have enough evidence to support $H_a$.\n\n### Example: Hypothesis Test for One Proportion\n\nA concern was raised in Australia that the percentage of deaths of Aboriginal prisoners was different than the percent of deaths of non-Aboriginal prisoners, which is 0.27%. A sample of six years (1990-1995) of data was collected, and it was found that out of 14,495 Aboriginal prisoners, 51 died (\\\\\"Indigenous deaths in,\\\\\" 1996). Do the data provide enough evidence to show that the proportion of deaths of Aboriginal prisoners is different from 0.27%?\n\n#### **Solution**\n\n1.  State the random variable and the parameter in words.\n\n$x$ = number of Aboriginal prisoners who die\n\n$p$ = proportion of Aboriginal prisoners who die\n\n2.  State the null and alternative hypotheses and the level of significance\n\n$H_o:p=0.0027$\n\n$H_a:p\\ne0.0027$\n\nFrom [Example: Stating Type I and II Errors and Picking Level of Significance] part b, the argument was made to pick 5% for the level of significance. So $\\alpha=0.05$\n\n3.  State and check the conditions for a hypothesis test\n\n<!-- -->\n\na.  A simple random sample of 14,495 Aboriginal prisoners was taken. Check: The sample was not a random sample, since it was data from six years. It is the numbers for all prisoners in these six years, but the six years were not picked at random. Unless there was something special about the six years that were chosen, the sample is probably a representative sample. This condition is probably met.\n\nb.  The properties of a binomial experiment are met. There are 14,495 prisoners in this case. Check: The prisoners are all Aboriginals, so you are not mixing Aboriginal with non-Aboriginal prisoners. There are only two outcomes, either the prisoner dies or doesn't. The chance that one prisoner dies over another may not be constant, but if you consider all prisoners the same, then it may be close to the same probability. Thus the conditions for the binomial distribution are satisfied\n\nc.  The sampling distribution of $\\hat{p}$ can be approximated with a normal distributed. Check: In this case $p = 0.0027$ and $n = 14,495$. $n*p=39.1365\\ge5$ and $n*q=14455.86\\ge5$. So, the sampling distribution for $\\hat{p}$ is normally distributed.\n\n<!-- -->\n\n4.  Find the sample statistic, test statistic, and p-value\n\nUse the following command in rStudio:\n\n```{r prop-test6}\nprop.test(51, 14495, p=0.0027)\n```\n\nSample Proportion: $\\hat{p}=0.0035$\n\nTest Statistic: $\\chi^2=3.3085$\n\np-value: $p-value=0.06893$\n\n5.

Interpretation\n\nThere is not enough evidence to support that the proportion of deaths of Aboriginal prisoners is different from non-Aboriginal prisoners.\n\n### Example: Hypothesis Test for One Proportion\n\nA researcher who is studying the effects of income levels on breastfeeding of infants hypothesizes that countries with a low income level have a different rate of infant breastfeeding than higher income countries. It is known that in Germany, considered a high-income country by the World Bank, 22% of all babies are breastfeed. In Tajikistan, considered a low-income country by the World Bank, researchers found that in a random sample of 500 new mothers that 125 were breastfeeding their infant. At the 5% level of significance, does this show that low-income countries have a different incident of breastfeeding?\n\n#### Solution\n\n1.  State you random variable and the parameter in words.\n\n$x$ = number of woman who breastfeed in a low-income country\n\n$p$ = proportion of woman who breastfeed in a low-income country\n\n2.  State the null and alternative hypotheses and the level of significance\n\n$H_o:p=0.22$\n\n$H_a:p\\ne0.22$\n\n$\\alpha=0.05$\n\n3.  State and check the conditions for a hypothesis test\n\n<!-- -->\n\na.  A simple random sample of 500 breastfeeding habits of woman in a low-income country was taken. Check: This was stated in the problem.\n\nb.  The properties of a Binomial Experiment have been met. Check: There were 500 women in the study. The women are considered identical, though they probably have some differences. There are only two outcomes, either the woman breastfeeds or she doesn't. The probability of a woman breastfeeding is probably not the same for each woman, but it is probably not very different for each woman. The conditions for the binomial distribution are satisfied\n\nc.  The sampling distribution of $\\hat{p}$ can be approximated with a normal distributed. Check: In this case, $n = 500$ and $p = 0.22$. $n*p= 110\\ge5$ and $n*q=390\\ge5$, so the sampling distribution of $\\hat{p}$ is well approximated by a normal curve.\n\n<!-- -->\n\n4.  Find the sample statistic, test statistic, and p-value\n\nOn r studio, use the following command\n\n```{r prop-test6a}\nprop_test(125, 500, p=0.22) \n```\n\nSample Statistic: $\\hat{p}=0.25$\n\ntest Statistic: $\\chi^2=2.4505$\n\np-value: $p-value=0.1175$\n\n5.  Conclusion\n\nSince the p-value is more than 0.05, you fail to reject $H_o$.\n\n6.  Interpretation\n\nThere is not enough evidence to support that the proportion of women who breastfeed in low-income countries is different from the proportion of women in high-income countries who breastfeed.\n\nNotice, the conclusion is that there wasn't enough evidence to support $H_a$. The conclusion was not that you support $H_o$. There are many reasons why you can't say that $H_o$ is true. It could be that the countries you chose were not very representative of what truly happens. If you instead looked at all high-income countries and compared them to low-income countries, you might have different results. It could also be that the sample you collected in the low-income country was not representative. It could also be that income level is not an indication of breastfeeding habits. It could be that the sample that was taken didn't show evidence but another sample would show evidence. There could be other factors involved. This is why you can't say that you support $H_o$. There are too many other factors that could be the reason that you failed to reject $H_0$.\n\n### Homework for One-Sample Proportion Test Section\n\n**In each problem show all steps of the hypothesis test. If some of the conditions are not met, note that the results of the test may not be correct and then continue the process of the hypothesis test.**\n\n1.  The Arizona Republic/Morrison/Cronkite News poll published on Monday, October 20, 2016, found 390 of the registered voters surveyed favor Proposition 205, which would legalize marijuana for adults. The statewide telephone poll surveyed 779 registered voters between Oct. 10 and Oct. 15. (Sanchez, 2016) Fifty-five percent of Colorado residents supported the legalization of marijuana. Does the data provide evidence that the percentage of Arizona residents who support legalization of marijuana is different from the proportion of Colorado residents who support it. Test at the 1% level.\n\n2.  In July of 1997, Australians were asked if they thought unemployment would increase, and 47% thought that it would increase. In November of 1997, they were asked again. At that time 284 out of 631 said that they thought unemployment would increase (\\\\\"Morgan Gallup poll,\\\\\" 2013). At the 5% level, is there enough evidence to show that the proportion of Australians in November 1997 who believe unemployment would increase is different from the proportion who felt it would increase in July 1997?\n\n3.  According to the February 2008 Federal Trade Commission report on consumer fraud and identity theft, 23% of all complaints in 2007 were for identity theft. In that year, Arkansas had 1,601 complaints of identity theft out of 3,482 consumer complaints (\\\\\"Consumer fraud and,\\\\\" 2008). Does this data provide enough evidence to show that Arkansas had a different percentage of identity theft than 23%? Test at the 5% level.\n\n4.  According to the February 2008 Federal Trade Commission report on consumer fraud and identity theft, 23% of all complaints in 2007 were for identity theft. In that year, Alaska had 321 complaints of identity theft out of 1,432 consumer complaints (\\\\\"Consumer fraud and,\\\\\" 2008). Does this data provide enough evidence to show that Alaska had a different proportion of identity theft than 23%? Test at the 5% level.\n\n5.  In 2001, the Gallup poll found that 81% of American adults believed that there was a conspiracy in the death of President Kennedy. In 2013, the Gallup poll asked 1,039 American adults if they believe there was a conspiracy in the assassination, and found that 634 believe there was a conspiracy (\\\\\"Gallup news service,\\\\\" 2013). Do the data show that the proportion of Americans who believe in this conspiracy has changed? Test at the 1% level.\n\n6.  In 2008, there were 507 children in Arizona out of 32,601 who were diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) (\\\\\"Autism and developmental,\\\\\" 2008). Nationally 1 in 88 children are diagnosed with ASD (\\\\\"CDC features -,\\\\\" 2013). Is there sufficient data to show that the incident of ASD is different in Arizona than nationally? Test at the 1% level.\n\n## One-Sample Test for the Mean\n\nIt is time to go back to look at the test for the mean that was introduced in section 7.1 called the $z$-test. In the example, you knew what the population standard deviation, $\\sigma$, was. What if you don't know $\\sigma$?\n\nIf you don't know $\\sigma$, then you don't know the sampling distribution of the mean. Can it be found another way? The answer is of course, yes. One way is to use a method called resampling. The following example explains how resampling is performed.\n\n### Example: Resampling\n\nA random sample of 10 body mass index (BMI) were taken from the NHANES Data frame The mean BMI of Australians is 27.2 $kg/m^2$. Is there evidence that Americans have a different BMI from people in Australia. Test at the 5% level.\n\n#### Solution\n\nThe standard deviation of BMI is not known for Australians. To answer this questions, first look at the sample from NHANES @tbl-NHANES-10-sample.\n\n```{r NHANES-10-sample}\n#| tbl-alt: \"Sample of size 10 from NHANES data frame\"\n#| label: tbl-NHANES-10-sample\n#| tbl-cap: \"Sample of size 10 from NHANES\"\nsample_NHANES_10<- \n  NHANES |>\n  slice_sample(n=10)\nknitr::kable(head(sample_NHANES_10))\n```\n\nThe mean BMI from this sample is\n\n```{r NHANES-10-stats, warning=FALSE}\ndf_stats(~BMI, data=sample_NHANES_10, mean)\n```\n\nThe sample mean for Americans is different from the mean BMI for Australians, but could it just be by chance. Suppose you take another sample of size 10, but you only have these 10 BMIs to work with. So how could you do this. One way is to assume that the sample you took is representative of the entire population, and so you create a population by copying this sample over and over again. So you could have over 1000 copies of this sample of 10 BMIs. Then take a sample of size 10 from this created population. When doing this, you could conceivably choose the same number several times that was in the original sample and not choose some of the numbers that were in the original sample. Instead of physically creating this new population, you could just take samples from your original sample but with replacement. This means that you randomly pick the first number, record it, and then put it back that value back before collecting the next number. This kind a sampling is called **randomization sampling**. A sample using randomization could be @tbl-NHANES-10-resample.\n\n```{r sample_NHANES_10-resample}\n#| tbl-alt: \"Resamling from HNANES sample\"\n#| label: tbl-NHANES-10-resample\n#| tbl-cap: \"Resample from NHANES Sample\"\nknitr::kable(resample(sample_NHANES_10))\n```\n\nNotice that some of the unit of observations are repeated. That is what happens when you resample. Now one resampling isn't enough. So you want to resample many times so you can create a resampling distribution @fig-NHANES-10-resample-histogram\n\n```{r sample-NHANES10-resample-histogram}\n#| fig-alt: \"Resampling distribution of mean BMI with sample size 10, and measured sample mean.\"\n#| label: fig-NHANES-10-resample-histogram\n#| fig-cap: \"Resampling distribution of mean BMI with sample size 10\"\n#| warning: FALSE\n# mutate NHANES to subtract 27.2 (Australia's BMI) from US BMI measurements \nmutate_NHANES <- NHANES |>\n  mutate(NewBMI=BMI-27.2)\n# Generate the single sample\nSingle_sample<- mutate_NHANES |>\n  sample_n(size = 10)\n#Calculate the mean age of the single sample \nSingle_sample_mean <- \n  Single_sample |>\n  df_stats( ~ NewBMI, means = mean)\n#Take 200 resamples from the single sample\nTrials_resample <- \n  do(200) * { Single_sample |>\n      resample() |>\n      df_stats( ~ NewBMI, means = mean) }\n# Plot the resample distribution of means\ngf_density( ~ means, data = Trials_resample, bins = 10) |>\n  gf_lims(x = c(-5, 10)) |>\n  gf_labs(title = \"Resampling Distribution\") |>\n  gf_vline(data = Single_sample_mean, xintercept = ~ means, color=\"red\")\ndf_stats( ~ means, data = Trials_resample, mean, sd)\n```\n\nNotice the sample mean from the resampling is very close to 0, so that means that the US BMI are not that different from the Australian BMI. There doesn't seem to be enough evidence to show that the US BMI is different from the Australian BMI. One note, the sample size used here was 10 so you could see the sample, but really the sample size should be more than 100 for this method to be valid.\n\nSo this is one way to answer the question about if there is evidence to show a population mean is different from a value. This is actually the method that Ronald Fisher developed when he create all the foundation work that he did in statistics in the early 1900s. However, at the time, computers didn't exist, so taking 100 resampling samples was not possible at that time. So other methods had to be developed that could be computed during that time. One method was developed by William (W.S) Gossett, a Chemist who worked for Guinness as their head brewer. Gossett developed a distribution called the Student's T-distribution. His process was to use the sample standard deviation, $s$, as an approximation of $\\sigma$. This means the test statistic is now $t=\\frac{x-\\mu}{\\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}}$. This new test statistic is actually distributed as a Student's t-distribution, developed by W.S. Gossett. There are some conditions that must be made for this formula to be a Student's t-distribution. These are outlined in the following theorem. Note: the t-distribution is called the Student's t-distribution because that is the name he published under because he couldn't publish under his own name due to his employer not wanting him to publish under his own name. His employer by the way was Guinness and they didn't want competitors knowing they had a chemist/statistician working for them. It is not called the Student's t-distribution because it is only used by students.\n\nTheorem: If the following conditions are met\n\na.  A random sample of size $n$ is taken.\n\nb.  The distribution of the random variable is normal.\n\nThen the distribution of is a Student's t-distribution with $n-1$ degrees of freedom.\n\n**Explanation of degrees of freedom**: Recall the formula for sample standard deviation is $\\sqrt{{\\frac{\\sum{x-\\bar{x}}}{n-1}}}$. Notice the denominator is $n-1$. This is the same as the degrees of freedom. This is no accident. The reason the denominator and the degrees of freedom are both comes from how the standard deviation is calculated. First you take each data value and subtract $\\bar{x}$. If you add up all of these new values, you will get 0. This must happen. Since it must happen, the first $n-1$ data values you have \"freedom of choice\", but the nth data value, you have no freedom to choose. Hence, you have $n-1$ degrees of freedom. Another way to think about it is that if you five people and five chairs, the first four people have a choice of where they are sitting, but the last person does not. They have no freedom of where to sit. Only $n-1$ people have freedom of choice.\n\nThe Student's t-distribution is bell-shape that is more spread out than the normal distribution. There are many $t$-distributions, one for each different degree of freedom.\n\n@fig-tdistribution-graph is of the normal distribution and the Student's t-distribution for df = 1, df = 3, df=8, df=30.\n\n```{r tdistribution-graph}\n#| fig-alt: \"Student t distributions with different degrees of freedom and normal curve.\"\n#| label: fig-tdistribution-graph\n#| echo: FALSE\n#| fig-cap: \"Typical Student t-Distributions\"\nx <- seq(-4, 4, length=100) \nhx <- dnorm(x)\ndegf <- c(1, 3, 8, 30) \ncolors <- c(\"red\", \"blue\", \"darkgreen\", \"gold\", \"black\") \nlabels <- c(\"df=1\", \"df=3\", \"df=8\", \"df=30\", \"normal\")\nplot(x, hx, type=\"l\", lty=2, xlab=\"x value\", ylab=\"Density\", main=\"Comparison of t Distributions\")\nfor (i in 1:4){ lines(x, dt(x,degf[i]), lwd=2, col=colors[i]) }\nlegend(\"topright\", inset=.05, title=\"Distributions\", \n       labels, lwd=2, lty=c(1, 1, 1, 1, 2), col=colors) \n```\n\nAs the degrees of freedom increases, the student's t-distribution looks more like the normal distribution.\n\nTo find probabilities for the t-distribution, again technology can do this for you. There are many technologies out there that you can use.\n\n### **Hypothesis Test for One Population Mean (t-Test)**\n\n1.  State the random variable and the parameter in words.\n\n$x$ = random variable\n\n$\\mu$ = mean of random variable\n\n2.  State the null and alternative hypotheses and the level of significance\n\n$H_o:\\mu=\\mu_o$ , where $\\mu_o$ is the known mean\n\n$H_a:\\mu\\ne\\mu_o$, you can also use \\< or \\>, but $\\ne$ is the more modern one to use.\n\nAlso, state your $\\alpha$ level here.\n\n3.  State and check the conditions for a hypothesis test\n\n<!-- -->\n\na.  State: A random sample of size $n$ is taken. Check: Describe the process taken to collect the sample.\n\nb.  State: The population of the random variable is normally distributed. Check: examine density graph and normal quantile plot. Note: The t-test is fairly robust to the condition if the sample size is large. This means that if this condition isn't met, but your sample size is quite large, then the results of the t-test are valid.\n\n<!-- -->\n\n4.  Find the sample statistic, test statistic, and p-value\n\nOn rStudio, the command is\n\nt.test(\\~variable, data=data_frame, mu=what_Ho_says)\n\n5.  Conclusion\n\nThis is where you write reject or fail to reject $H_o$. The rule is: if the p-value $<\\alpha$, then reject $H_o$. If the p-value $\\ge \\alpha$, then fail to reject $H_o$\n\n6.  Interpretation\n\nThis is where you interpret in real world terms the conclusion to the test. The conclusion for a hypothesis test is that you either have enough evidence to support $H_a$, or you do not have enough evidence to support $H_a$.\n\nNote: if the conditions behind this test are not valid, then the conclusions you make from the test are not valid. If you do not have a random sample, that is your fault. Make sure the sample you take is as random as you can make it following sampling techniques from chapter 1. If the population of the random variable is not normal, then take a larger sample. If you cannot afford to do that, or if it is not logistically possible, then you do different tests called non-parametric tests or you can try resampling. The advantage fo resampling is that you don't need to know the under laying distribution of the random variable.\n\n### Example: Test of the Mean Using One Sample T-test\n\nA random sample of 50 body mass index (BMI) were taken from the NHANES Data frame @tbl-sample_NHANES_50. The mean BMI of Australians is 27.2 $kg/m^2$. Is there evidence that Americans have a different BMI from people in Australia. Test at the 5% level.\n\n```{r sample_NHANES-50-data}\n#| tbl-alt: \"Head of BMI of Americans\"\n#| label: tbl-sample_NHANES_50\n#| tbl-cap: \"BMI of Americans\"\nsample_NHANES_50<- sample_n(NHANES, size=50) \nknitr::kable(head(sample_NHANES_50))\n```\n\n#### **Solution**\n\n1.  State the random variable and the parameter in words.\n\n$x$ = BMI of an American\n\n$\\mu$ = mean BMI of Americans\n\n2.  State the null and alternative hypotheses and the level of significance\n\n$H_o:\\mu=27.2$\n\n$H_a:\\mu\\ne 27.2$\n\nlevel of significance $\\alpha=0.05$\n\n3.  State and check the conditions for a hypothesis test\n\n<!-- -->\n\na.  A random sample of 50 BMI levels was taken. Check: A random sample was taken from the NHANES data frame using r Studio\n\nb.  The population of BMI levels is normally distributed. Check:\n\n(ref:sample-NHANES-50-density-cap) Density Plot of BMI from NHANES sample\n\n```{r sample-NHANES-50-density}\n#| fig-alt: \"Density plot of BMI. Slightly right skewed\"\n#| warning: FALSE\n#| label: fig-sample-NHANES-50-density\n#| fig-cap: \"Density Plot of BMI from NHANES sample\"\ngf_density(~BMI, data=sample_NHANES_50, title=\"Body Mass Index\", xlab=\"Body Mass Index\")\ngf_qq(~BMI, data=sample_NHANES_50, title=\"Body Mass Index\", xlab=\"Body Mass Index\")\n```\n\nThe density plot looks somewhat skewed right and the normal quantile plot looks somewhat linear. However, there doesn't seem to be strong evidence that the sample comes from a population that is normally distributed. However, since the sample is moderate to large, the $t$-test is robust to this condition not being met. So the results of the test are probably valid.\n\n4.  Find the sample statistic, test statistic, and $p$-value\n\nOn rStudio, the command would be\n\n```{r, t-test-NHANES-50}\nt.test(~BMI, data= sample_NHANES_50, mu=27.2) \n```\n\nThe test statistic is the $t$ in the output, the sample statistic is the mean of $x$ in the output, and the $p$-value is the $p$-value is the output.\n\n5.  Conclusion\n\nSince the $p$-value is not less than 5%, then fail to reject $H_o$.\n\n6.  Interpretation\n\nThere is not enough evidence to support that Americans have a different BMI from Australians.\n\nNote: this is the same conclusion that was found when using resampling. So the two method could give similar conclusions.\n\n### Example: Test of the Mean Using One Sample T-test\n\nIn 2011, the average life expectancy for a woman in Europe was 79.8 years.

The FDA regulates that fish that is consumed is allowed to contain 1.0 mg/kg of mercury. In Florida, bass fish were collected in 53 different lakes to measure the health of the lakes. The data frame of measurements from Florida lakes is in @tbl-Mercury (NISER 081107 ID Data, 2019). Do the data provide enough evidence to show that the fish in Florida lakes has different amounts of mercury than the allowable amount?

Water samples were collected from the surface of the middle of each lake in August 1990 and then again in March 1991. The pH level, the amount of chlorophyll, calcium, and alkalinity were measured in each sample. The average of the August and March values were used in the analysis. Next, a sample of fish was taken from each lake with sample sizes ranging from 4 to 44 fish. The age of each fish and mercury concentration in the muscle tissue was measured. (Note: Since fish absorb mercury over time, older fish will tend to have higher concentrations). Thus, to make a fair comparison of the fish in different lakes, the investigators used a regression estimate of the expected mercury concentration in a three year old fish as the standardized value for each lake. Finally, in 10 of the 53 lakes, the age of the individual fish could not be determined and the average mercury concentration of the sampled fish was used instead of the standardized value.

A study was conducted to see how steady the elderly is on their feet. They had the subjects stand on a force platform and have them react to a noise. The force platform then measured how much they swayed forward and backward, and the data is in @tbl-Sway (Maintaining Balance while Concentrating, 2019). Do the data show that the elderly sway more than the mean forward sway of younger people, which is 18.125 mm? Test at the 5% level.

It is more difficult when you are older? Nine elderly (6 men and 3 women) and eight young men were subjects in an experiment. Each subject stood barefoot on a \"force platform\" and was asked to maintain a stable upright position and to react as quickly as possible to an unpredictable noise by pressing a hand held button. The noise came randomly and the subject concentrated on reacting as quickly as possible. The platform automatically measured how much each subject swayed in millimeters in both the forward/backward and the side-to-side directions.\n\nThis data frame contains the following columns:\n\nAge: Elderly or Young\n\nFBSway: Sway in forward/backward direction\n\nSideSwayy: Sway in side to side direction\n\nSource Maintaining Balance while Concentrating.
