    "text": "11.1 Regression\nWhen comparing different variables, two questions come to mind: “Is there a relationship between two variables?” and “How strong is that relationship?” These questions can be answered using regression and correlation. Regression answers whether there is a relationship, (again this book will explore linear relationships only) and correlation answers how strong the linear relationship is. The variable that is used to explain the change (or variability) in the other variable is called the explanatory variable or predictor variable, while the variable whose variability is being explained is called the response variable. In general, variables that help to explain the changes in a response variable are known as covariates. To introduce the concepts of regression and correlation, it is easier to look at a set of data.",

First, it is helpful to state the variables, and since variables in an algebra class are typically represented as \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), those labels will be used here. It helps to state which variable is \\(x\\) (explanatory or predictor) and which is \\(y\\) (response).\nState variables\n\\(x\\) = alcohol content in the beer\n\\(y\\) = calories in 12 ounce beer\n\nClick to expand the box below see how to create the scatterplot of calories vs. alcohol content.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Creating Scatterplot of Calories vs. Alcohol Content\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore you begin: Make sure you have already imported the beer_data dataset into your Rguroo account, as shown here.\n\nOpen the Plots toolbox in Rguroo.\n\nOpen the Create Plot dropdown and select Scatterplot. This opens the Scatterplot dialog.\n\nIn the Scatterplot dialog, choose the beer_data dataset from the Dataset dropdown.\n\nChoose the alcohol variable from the Predictor (x) dropdown.\n\nChoose the calories variable from the Response (y) dropdown.\n\n(Optional) In the Label section of the dialog:\n\nEnter Calories versus Alcohol Content in Beer in the Title textbox.\n\nEnter Alcohol Content in the X-Axis textbox.\n\nEnter Number of Calories in the Y-Axis textbox.\n\n\nClick the preview icon  to see a preview of the scatterplot.\nIn the  textbox, enter the name AlcoholCalorieScatter for the scatterplot.

The process is to draw a line through the data and measure the vertical distance from each point to the line. These distances are called the residuals. The regression line is the line that makes the sum of the square of the residuals as small as possible, which is why it is sometimes called the least squares line. The regression line on the scatter plot is displayed in Figure 11.2.\n\nClick to expand the box below to see how to add a regression line to the scatterplot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Adding Regression Line to a Scatterplot\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore you begin: Ensure you have created the scatterplot of calories vs. alcohol content in your Rguroo account, as shown here.\n\nOpen the Rguroo tab containing your scatterplot of calories vs. alcohol content by double-clicking the name AlcoholCalorieScatter in the Plots toolbox list.\nOpen the Basics dialog by clicking the  button.\n\nIn the Superimpose section of the dialog, select the checkbox LS Line.\n\nClick the preview icon  to see a preview of the scatterplot with the regression line.\nClick the  button to save the updated scatterplot as AlcoholCalorieScatterLS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here to see the Rguroo dialog\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScatterplot dialog for adding a least-squares line to a plot of alcohol content versus calorie counts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.2: Scatter Plot of Beer Data with Regression Line\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11.1.2 Find the regression equation (also known as best fitting line or least squares line)\nGiven a collection of paired sample data, the regression equation is \\(\\hat{y}=mx+b\\), where the slope = \\(m\\) and \\(y\\)-intercept = \\((0,b)\\).\nAs we will show, to find the linear model using Rguroo, we use the Linear Regression function in the Analytics toolbox.\nThe residuals are the difference between the actual observed values of the response and the corresponding estimated (predicted) values, namely \\(\\text{residual} = y - \\hat{y}\\).\nThe independent variable (the \\(x\\)-value) corresponds to the explanatory or predictor variable, the variable used to predict or explain changes in another variable. The dependent variable (the \\(y\\)-value) corresponds to the response variable—the variable whose values change in relation to the predictor. In our example, alcohol content is the predictor (independent, \\(x\\)) variable, and the number of calories is the response (dependent, \\(y\\)) variable, since it makes more sense to predict calories from alcohol content rather than vice versa.\nAssumptions for the Validity of the Regression Equation and Line:\n\nRandomness: The set of ordered pairs is a random sample from the population of all such possible pairs.\nLinearity: For a given \\(x\\)-value, the distribution of \\(y\\)-values has a mean that lies on the least squares line.\n\nThe assumption of linearity is essential. If the relationship between the two variables is not linear, then a regression line will not fit the data well. To check linearity, we look at the scatterplot: a roughly straight-line pattern suggests the assumption is reasonable, while a curved pattern suggests it is not. We can also examine the so called residual-versus-fit plot. If the residuals are randomly scattered around the horizontal line \\(y = 0\\) on this plot, the linearity assumption is likely valid. If the residuals show a curved pattern, then the assumption of linearity is likely violated.\nAssumptions for the validity of inference:\n\nConstant Variance: The variance of the \\(y\\)-values should be the same across all \\(x\\)-values.\nNormality: The \\(y\\)-values for each fixed value of \\(x\\) should follow a normal distribution.\n\nThe assumptions of constant variance and normality are primarily needed for the validity of inference in regression. Inference includes procedures such as constructing confidence intervals and carrying out hypothesis tests. Just as with the confidence intervals and hypothesis tests for means and proportions that you are already familiar with, we can construct confidence intervals and tests of hypotheses for the slope and intercept of the regression line, as well as for predicted values \\(\\hat{y}\\).\nAlthough this book does not cover inference for regression, it is helpful to understand the basic ideas behind the underlying assumptions. To check the constant-variance, we examine the residual-versus-fit plot: if the residuals are scattered with roughly the same vertical spread around the horizontal line \\(y = 0\\) across all fitted-values, the assumption is reasonable. A funnel-shaped pattern suggests that unequal variances.\nTo check normality, we look at a histogram or a normal probability plot of the residuals. The histogram should appear bell-shaped, and in a normal probability plot the residuals should fall roughly along a straight line; pronounced curvature or outliers indicate that the normality assumption may not be satisfied.\n\n\n11.1.3 Example: Find the Equation of the Regression Line\nIs there a relationship between the alcohol content and the number of calories in 12-ounce beer? To determine if there is one, we examine the sample of beer’s alcohol content and calories, portion of which is shown in Table 11.1 (Find Out How Many Calories in Beer?, 2019).\n\nFind the regression equation between alcohol content and calories.\nUse the regression equation to find the number of calories when the alcohol content is 7%.\nUse the regression equation to find the number of calories when the alcohol content is 14%.\n\n\n11.1.3.1 Solution\n\nFind the regression equation between alcohol content and calories.\n\nState random variables\n\\(x\\) = alcohol content in the beer\n\\(y\\) = calories in 12 ounce beer\n\nClick to expand the box below to see how to obtain the regression equation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Finding the Regression Equation for the Beer Data\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore you begin: Make sure you have already imported the beer_data dataset into your Rguroo account, as shown here.\n\nOpen the Analytics toolbox in Rguroo.\n\nOpen the Analysis dropdown and select Linear Regression → Simple Regression. This opens the Simple Linear Regression dialog.\n\nFrom the Dataset dropdown, choose the beer_data dataset.\n\nFrom the Predictor (x) dropdown, choose the alcohol variable.\n\nFrom the Response (y) dropdown, choose the calories variable.\n\nClick the preview icon  to view a preview of the regression results.\nClick the  button to save the regression results as AlcoholCalorieRegress.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here to see the Rguroo dialog\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimple Linear Regression dialog in Rguroo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRguroo output: Linear Regression for Beer Data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following is a portion of the output from Rguroo for this regression analysis.\n\n\n\n\nTable 11.2: Data and model summary for Alcohol Content versus Calories\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis table shows various information about the regression analysis. In particular, the last row, labeled “Equation of Least Squares Line,” gives the estimates for the slope and the \\(y\\)-intercept. Note that the equation states calories in place of \\(y\\) and alcohol in place of \\(x\\).\nFrom this, rounding the values, you can see that the y-intercept is 14.5 and the slope is 2672.4. So the regression equation is \\(\\hat{y}=2672.4x+14.5\\).\nRemember, this is an estimate for the true regression equation. A different sample would produce a different estimate.\nConditions check:\n\nRandomness: A random sample of alcohol content and calories was taken.\nCheck: There is no guarantee that this was a random sample. The data was collected off of a website, and the website does not say how the data was obtained. However, it is a collection of most popular beers from large breweries, so it may be alright that it isn’t a random sample.\nLinearity: For a given \\(x\\)-value, the distribution of \\(y\\)-values has a mean that lies on the least squares line.\n\nCheck:\nWe examine two graphs to check this condition: the scatter plot of \\(y\\) versus \\(x\\) and the residual-versus-fit plot.\n\nFigure 11.1 shows the scatterplot of calories versus alcohol content. This graph is also shown as part of the default output of the Linear Regression function in Rguroo. This scatterplot looks fairly linear, so this condition appears to be satisfied.\nFigure 11.3 shows the residual-versus-fit plot, which is also part of the Linear Regression function output in Rguroo. The points on this plot are obtained by calculating the fitted values and the residuals for each data point. For each \\(x\\)-value, a predicted value for \\(y\\) is computed using the equation of the least squares line; this predicted value is called the fitted value and is denoted by \\(\\hat{y}\\). The residual is then found by subtracting the fitted value from the observed \\(y\\)-value:\n\n\\[\n\\mbox{residual} = y - \\hat{y}.\n\\] Fortunately, Rguroo calculates these automatically for you.\nClick to expand the box below to see how to obtain the fitted (predicted) values and the residuals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Obtaining Residuals for the Beer Data\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore you begin: Continue with the Rguroo instructions shown here for obtaining the regression equation.\n\nOpen the Rguroo tab containing your regression fit by double-clicking the name AlcoholCalorieRegress in the Analytics toolbox list.\n\nClick the  button to open the Simple Linear Regression dialog.\nSelect the checkbox Predictions & Residuals.\nClick the preview icon  to see a preview of the regression results with residuals.\nClick the  button to save the updated regression results as AlcoholCalorieResiduals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here to see the Rguroo dialog\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimple Linear Regression dialog: Obtaining Residuals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to expand the box below to see the predicted (fitted) values and the residuals for the first 20 cases of the beer data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResiduals for Alcohol and Calorie Content in Beer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 11.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResiduals for Alcohol and Calorie Content in Beer from Rguroo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 11.4: Residuals for Alcohol and Calorie Content in Beer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.3: Residuals versus Fitted Values Plot for Beer Data\n\n\n\n\n\nThe points shown on the residual-versus-fit plot Figure 11.3 appear to be randomly scattered around the horizontal line \\(y = 0\\). There does not appear to be any curved pattern, so this condition appears to be satisfied.\n\nConstant Variance: The variance of the \\(y\\)-values should be the same across all \\(x\\)-values.\n\nLooking again at the residual-versus-fit plot Figure 11.3, the vertical spread of the residuals appears to be roughly the same across all fitted-values. There does not appear to be a funnel-shaped pattern, so this condition appears to be satisfied.\n\nNormality: The \\(y\\)-values for each fixed value of \\(x\\) should follow a normal distribution.\n\nTo check this assumption, we examine the normal probability plot of the residuals shown in Figure 11.4, which is also part of the Linear Regression function output in Rguroo. In this plot, the residuals fall roughly along a straight line, so this condition appears to be satisfied. More specifically, all points lie within the confidence bands ( shown as red dotted curves), and there is no pronounced curvature or outliers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.4: Normal Probability Plot for Beer Data\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the regression equation to find the number of calories when the alcohol content is 7.00%.\n\nTo make a prediction, we substitute the given alcohol content (expressed as a decimal) into the regression equation and compute the corresponding fitted value. In this example, we want to predict the number of calories for a beer with 7.00% alcohol content. Since 7.00% expressed as a decimal is 0.07, we substitute \\(x = 0.07\\) into the regression equation: \\[\n\\hat{y} = 2672 \\times 0.07 + 14.3 = 201.34.\n\\] This value, 201.34, is the predicted number of calories for a beer whose alcohol content is 7%. So, if you are drinking a beer that has 7.00% alcohol content, then it probably has close to 200 calories.\nConsidering all the data, the mean number of calories is 154.5. However, for beers with 7% alcohol content, the predicted value of 201 calories is a more appropriate estimate because the beers in the dataset with 7% alcohol all have between 160 and 231 calories. In this case, the regression equation provides a better estimate than simply using the overall mean.\n\nUse the regression equation to find the number of calories when the alcohol content is 14%.\n\n\\[\\hat{y}=2672*0.14+14.3=388.38\\]\nDiscuss: Shoud we add how you can get predicted values in Rguroo?\nIf you are drinking a beer that is 14% alcohol content, then it probably has close to 388 calories. Since, on average, a 12% alcohol beer has 330 calories, you might expect a 14% beer to have more calories than this. However, the maximum alcohol content in our dataset is 12%. The estimate for a 14% beer is therefore an example of extrapolation, because it is a prediction for an \\(x\\)-value outside the range of the data used to fit the model. It is not a good idea to predict values that fall far outside the range of the original data, because we cannot be sure that the regression relationship remains valid beyond the observed \\(x\\)-values.\nNotice that 7.00% alcohol is within the range of the original \\(x\\)-values. Predicting a value for an \\(x\\)-value inside the observed range is called interpolation. The 14.00% value is outside that range, and predicting for an \\(x\\)-value outside the original data is called extrapolation. When you interpolate, you can usually feel confident that the predicted value will be close to the true value because the model was created using data within that range and is intended to describe relationships only there. When you extrapolate, however, you cannot be sure the prediction is close to the true value, because the relationship may change for \\(x\\)-values beyond those observed when the model was created.\nDiscuss: The following example is vague. Can a linear model beused to predict? which model it is refereing to? Can we make it more specific or give another example such as relationship between age and height, say ages 5-12 which is linear but for example if we extrapolate say to age 40 we get a value that is not reasonable?\nAnother example of extrapolation is when you use regression to come up with an equation to predict the growth of a city, like Flagstaff, AZ. Based on analysis it was determined that the population of Flagstaff would be well over 50,000 by 1995. However, when a census was undertaken in 1995, the population was less than 50,000. This is because they extrapolated and the growth factor they were using had obviously changed from the early 1990’s. Growth factors can change for many reasons, such as employment growth, employment stagnation, disease, articles saying great place to live, etc. Realize that when you extrapolate, your predicted value may not be anywhere close to the actual value that you observe.\nWhat does the slope mean in the context of this problem?\nThe calories increase by 26.72 for every 1% increase in alcohol content.\nThe \\(y\\)-intercept in many cases is meaningless. In this case, it means that if a drink has 0 alcohol content, then it would have 14.3 calories which maybe a reasonable value.\n\nConsider the residuals again. According to the data, a beer with 7.0% alcohol has between 160 and 231 calories. The predicted value is 201 calories. This variation means that the actual value was between 40 calories below and 30 calories above the predicted value. That isn’t that far off. Some of the actual values differ by a large amount from the predicted value. This is due to variability in the response variable. The larger the residuals the less the model explains the variability in the response variable. There needs to be a way to calculate how well the model explains the variability in the response variable. This will be explored in the next section.\nOne last thing that you may wonder is if imported beer has a different number of calories than domestic beer. The location (imported versus domestic) is a covariate, a third variable that may affects the calorie content. A covariate that is a categorical variable is referred to as a factor. You can create a scatterplot that displays the data separately for each category of this covariate. Here is how to do this in Rguroo.\n\nClick to expand the box below to see how to create a scatterplot of calories vs. alcohol content separated by location.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Creating Scatterplot of Calories vs. Alcohol Content by Location\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore you begin: Make sure you have already imported the beer_data dataset into your Rguroo account, as shown here.\n\nOpen the Plots toolbox in Rguroo.\n\nOpen the Create Plot dropdown and select Scatterplot. This opens the Scatterplot dialog.\n\nIn the Scatterplot dialog, choose the beer_data dataset from the Dataset dropdown.\n\nChoose the alcohol variable from the Predictor (x) dropdown.\n\nChoose the calories variable from the Response (y) dropdown.\nChoose the location variable from the Factor dropdown.\nIn the superimpose section of the dialog, select the checkbox LS Line by Factor.\n\n(Optional) In the Label section of the dialog:\n\nEnter Calories versus Alcohol Content in Beer by Location in the Title textbox.\n\nEnter Alcohol Content in the X-Axis textbox.\n\nEnter Number of Calories in the Y-Axis textbox.\n\n\nClick the preview icon  to see a preview of the scatterplot.\nIn the  textbox, enter the name AlcoholCalorieLocationScatter for the scatterplot.

The least squares lines for each location are also shown. Looking at the scatter plot, there doesn’t appear to be an affect from domestic or import. This is what is nice about scatter plots, You can visually see a possible relationships.\n\n11.1.4 Homework for Regression Section\nFor each problem, state the random variables.

When miles per gallon and horsepower are transformed to logarithms, the linearity of the regression is improved. A negative second order term is required to fit the logarithmic mileage to weight relation. If the logged variables are standardized, the coefficients of the first order terms indicate the standard units change in log mileage per one standard unit change in the predictor variable at the (logarithmic) mean. This change is constant in the case of mileage to horsepower, but not for mileage to weight. The coefficient of the second order weight term indicates the change in standardized slope associated with a one standard deviation increase in the logarithm of weight.\nFormat\nThis Data Frame contains the following columns:\nmake: the type of car\nvol: cubic feet of cab space\nhp: engine horsepower\nnpg: the average mileage of the car\nsp: top speed (mph)\nwt: the weight of the car (100 pounds)\nSource (n.d.).

Correlation is a word used in every day life and many people think they understand what it means. What it really means is a measure of how strong the linear relationship is between two variables. However, it doesn’t give you a strong indication of how well the relationship explains the variability in the response variable, and it doesn’t work for more than two variables. There is a way to look at how much of the relationship explains the variability in the response variable.\nThere are many types of patterns one can see in the data. Common types of patterns are linear, exponential, logarithmic, or periodic. To see this pattern, you can draw a scatter plot of the data.This course will mostly deal with linear, but the other patterns exist.\nThere is some variability in the response variable values, such as calories. Some of the variation in calories is due to alcohol content and some is due to other factors. How much of the variation in the calories is due to alcohol content?\nWhen considering this question, you want to look at how much of the variation in calories is explained by alcohol content and how much is explained by other variables. Realize that some of the changes in calories have to do with other ingredients. You can have two beers at the same alcohol content, but one beer has higher calories because of the other ingredients. Some variability is explained by the model and some variability is not explained. Together, both of these give the total variability. This is (total variation)=(explained variation)+(unexplained variation)\nThe proportion of the variation that is explained by the model is \\(R^2=\\frac{\\text{explained variation}}{\\text{total variation}}\\)\nThis is known as the coefficient of determination.\nTo find the coefficient of determination, on r Studio, the command is to first name the linear model to be something and then you can find the summary of that named linear model. The next example shows how to find this.\n\n11.2.1 Example: Find the coefficient of determination \\(R^2\\)\nHow well does the alcohol content of a beer explain the variability in the number of calories in 12-ounce beer? To determine this a sample of beer’s alcohol content and calories (Find Out How Many Calories in Beer?, 2019), is in Table 11.1.\n\n11.2.1.1 Solution\nState random variables\n\\(x\\) = alcohol content in the beer\n\\(y\\) = calories in 12 ounce beer\nFirst find and name the linear model, how about lm_out_beer, so you can refer to it. Then use the command\n\nlm_out_beer&lt;-lm(calories~alcohol, data=Beer) #creates the linear model and calls it lm_out_beer \nrsquared(lm_out_beer) #finds the rsquared of the linear model created.\n\n[1] 0.8164314\n\n\nThe \\(R^2=0.8164\\). Thus, 81.64% of the variation in calories is explained to the linear relationship between alcohol content and calories. The other 18.36% of the variation is due to other factors. A really good coefficient of determination has a very small, unexplained part. So this means you probably don’t need to look for a co-variate.\nThis is all you have to do to find how much of the variability in the response variable is explained by the linear model.\nIf you do want to talk about correlation, correlation is another measure of the strength of the linear relationship. The symbol for the coefficient correlation is \\(r\\). To find \\(r\\), it is the square root of \\(R^2\\). So \\(r=\\sqrt{R^2}\\). So all you need to do is take the square root of the answer you already found. The only thing is that when you take a square root of both sides of an equation you need the \\(\\pm\\) symbol. This is because you don’t know if you want the positive or negative root. However, remember to read graphs from left to right, the same as you read words. If the graph goes up the correlation is positive and if the graph goes down the correlation is negative. Just affix the correct sign to the \\(r\\) value. You can also use this command and r will give you the correct sign.\ncor(respose_variable~explanatory_variable, data=Data_Frame)\nThe linear correlation coefficient is a number that describes the strength of the linear relationship between the two variables. It is also called the Pearson correlation coefficient after Karl Pearson who developed it.\n\n\n\n11.2.2 Interpretation of the correlation coefficient\n\\(r\\) is always between \\(-1\\) and 1. \\(r\\) = \\(-1\\) means there is a perfect negative linear correlation and \\(r\\) = 1 means there is a perfect positive correlation. The closer \\(r\\) is to 1 or \\(-1\\), the stronger the correlation. The closer \\(r\\) is to 0, the weaker the correlation. CAREFUL: \\(r\\) = 0 does not mean there is no correlation. It just means there is no linear correlation. There might be a very strong curved pattern.\n\n\n11.2.3 Example: Calculating the Linear Correlation Coefficient, \\(r\\)\nHow strong is the positive relationship between the alcohol content and the number of calories in 12-ounce beer? To determine if there is a linear correlation, a random sample was taken of beer’s alcohol content and calories for several different beers (\\“Calories in beer,,\\” 2011), and the Data Frame are in Table 11.1. Find the correlation coefficient and interpret that value.\n\n11.2.3.1 Solution\nState random variables\n\\(x\\) = alcohol content in the beer\n\\(y\\) = calories in 12 ounce beer\nFrom example 10.2.1, \\(R^2=0.8164\\). The correlation coefficient = \\(r=\\sqrt{r^2}=\\sqrt{0.8164}=0.9035486\\), or use this command in r\n\ncor(calories~alcohol, data=Beer)\n\n[1] 0.9035659\n\n\nThe scatter graph went up from left to right, so the correlation coefficient is positive. Since 0.90 is close to 1, then that means there is a fairly strong positive correlation.\n\n\n\n11.2.4 Causation\nOne common mistake people make is to assume that because there is a correlation, then one variable causes the other. This is usually not the case. That would be like saying the amount of alcohol in the beer causes it to have a certain number of calories. However, fermentation of sugars is what causes the alcohol content. The more sugars you have, the more alcohol can be made, and the more sugar, the higher the calories. It is actually the amount of sugar that causes both. Do not confuse the idea of correlation with the concept of causation. Just because two variables are correlated does not mean one causes the other to happen. However, the new theory is showing that if you have a relationship between two variables and a strong correlation, and you can show that there are no other variables that could explain the change, then you can show causation. This is how doctors have shown that smoking causes kidney cancer. Just realize that proving that one caused the other is a difficult process, and causation should not be just assumed.\n\n\n11.2.5 Example: Correlation Versus Causation\n\nA study showed a strong linear correlation between per capita beer consumption and teacher’s salaries. Does giving a teacher a raise cause people to buy more beer? Does buying more beer cause teachers to get a raise?\nA study shows that there is a correlation between people who have had a root canal and those that have cancer. Does that mean having a root canal causes cancer?\n\n\n11.2.5.1 Solution\n\nA study showed a strong linear correlation between per capita beer consumption and teacher’s salaries. Does giving a teacher a raise cause people to buy more beer? Does buying more beer cause teachers to get a raise?\nThere is probably some other factor causing both of them to increase at the same time. Think about this: In a town where people have little extra money, they won’t have money for beer and they won’t give teachers raises. In another town where people have more extra money to spend it will be easier for them to buy more beer and they would be more willing to give teachers raises.\n\n\n\nA study shows that there is a correlation between people who have had a root canal and those that have cancer. Does that mean having a root canal causes cancer?\nJust because there is positive correlation doesn’t mean that one caused the other. It turns out that there is a positive correlation between eating carrots and cancer, but that doesn’t mean that eating carrots causes cancer. In other words, there are lots of relationships you can find between two variables, but that doesn’t mean that one caused the other.\n\nRemember a correlation only means a pattern exists. It does not mean that one variable causes the other variable to change.\n\n\n\n11.2.6 Homework for Correlation Section\nFor each problem, state the random variables.The Data Frame in this section are in section 10.1 and will be used in section 10.3.\n\nWhen an anthropologist finds skeletal remains, they need to figure out the height of the person.

But how do you now how good that estimate is? First you need a measure of the variability in the estimate, called the standard error of the estimate. The definition of the standard error of the estimate is how much error is in the estimate from the regression equation.\nStandard Error of the Estimate formula \\(S_e=\\sum{(\\hat{y}-y)^2}\\)\nThis formula is hard to work with but luckily r Studio will calculate it for you. In fact the command has already been used, so this information is already found. The command is\nsummary(lm_out) #lm_out is the name you gave the linear model\n\n11.3.1 Example: Finding the Standard Error of the Estimate\nIs there a relationship between the alcohol content and the number of calories in 12-ounce beer? To determine if there is a sample of beer’s alcohol content and calories (Find Out How Many Calories in Beer?, 2019), in Table 11.1. Find the standard error of the estimate.\nCode book for data frame Beer is below Table 11.1.\n\n11.3.1.1 Solution\n\\(x\\) = alcohol content in the beer\n\\(y\\) = calories in 12 ounce beer\nFirst save the linear model with a name like lm_out_beer. Then use summary(lm_out_beer) to find the standard error of the estimate.\n\nlm_out_beer=lm(calories~alcohol, data=Beer) \nsummary(lm_out_beer)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = calories ~ alcohol, data = Beer)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-51.869 -11.421  -0.145  11.855  55.473 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(&gt;|t|)    \n(Intercept)   14.527      4.577   3.174  0.00171 ** \nalcohol     2672.359     84.478  31.634  &lt; 2e-16 ***\n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\nResidual standard error: 17.62 on 225 degrees of freedom\nMultiple R-squared:  0.8164,    Adjusted R-squared:  0.8156 \nF-statistic:  1001 on 1 and 225 DF,  p-value: &lt; 2.2e-16\n\n\nThe standard error of the estimate is the residual standard error in the output. So the standard error of the estimate for the number of calories in a beer related to alcohol content is \\(S_e=17.62\\)\n\n\n\n11.3.2 Prediction Interval\nUsing the regression equation you can predict the number of calories from the alcohol content. However, you only find one value. The problem is that beers vary a bit in calories even if they have the same alcohol content. It would be nice to have a range instead of a single value. The range is called a prediction interval.\n\n\n11.3.3 Prediction Interval for an Individual \\(y\\)\nGiven the fixed value \\(x\\), the prediction interval for an individual \\(y\\) is \\(\\hat{y}\\pm E\\) where \\(E\\) is the error of the estimate.\nr will produce the prediction interval for you. The process follows\nTo calculate the linear model. Note this may already been done.\nlm_out = lm(explanatory_variable~ response_variable)\nThe following will compute a prediction interval. For the prediction variable set to a particular value (put that value in place of the word value), at a particular C level (given as a decimal).\npredict(lm_out, newdata=list(prediction_variable = value), interval=“prediction”, level=C)\n\n\n11.3.4 Example \\#10.3.2: Find the Prediction Interval\nIs there a relationship between the alcohol content and the number of calories in 12-ounce beer? To determine if there is a sample of beer’s alcohol content and calories (Find Out How Many Calories in Beer?, 2019), in Table 11.1. Find a 95% prediction interval for the number of calories when the alcohol content is 7.0%. content and calories (\\“Calories in beer,,\\” 2011). The Data Frame is in Table 11.1.\n\n11.3.4.1 Solution\n\\(x\\) = alcohol content in the beer\n\\(y\\) = calories in 12 ounce beer\nComputing the prediction interval using r Studio\n\npredict(lm_out_beer, newdata=list(alcohol=0.07), interval = \"prediction\", level=0.95) \n\n       fit      lwr     upr\n1 201.5922 166.6664 236.518\n\n\nthe fit = 201.5922 is the number of calories in the beer when the alcohol content is 7.0%. The prediction interval is between the lower (lwr) and upper (upr). The prediction interval is 166.6664 and 236.528. That means that 95% of all beer that has 7.0% alcohol has between 167 and 237 calories.\n\n\n\n11.3.5 Hypothesis Test for Correlation or Slope:\nHow do you really say you have a correlation or a linear relationship? Can you test to see if there really is a correlation or linear relationship? Of course, the answer is yes. The hypothesis test for correlation is as follows.\n\nState the random variables in words.\n\n\\(x\\) = explanatory variable\n\\(y\\) = response variable\n\nState the null and alternative hypotheses and the level of significance\n\n\\(H_o: \\text{there is not a correlation or linear relationship}\\)\n\\(H_a: \\text{there is a correlation or linear relationship}\\)\nAlso, state your \\(\\alpha\\) level here.\n\nState and check the conditions for the hypothesis test\n\nThe conditions for the hypothesis test are the same conditions for regression and correlation.\n\nFind the test statistic and p-value\n\nThe test statistic and p-value is already in the summary(lm_out) output.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis is where you write reject \\(H_o\\) or fail to reject \\(H_o\\). The rule is: if the p-value \\(&lt;\\alpha\\), then reject \\(H_o\\). If the p-value \\(\\ge \\alpha\\), then fail to reject \\(H_o\\)\n\nInterpretation\n\nThis is where you interpret in real world terms the conclusion to the test.

    "text": "A correlation exists between two variables when the values of one variable are somehow associated with the values of the other variable. Correlation is a word used in every day life and many people think they understand what it means. What it really means is a measure of how strong the linear relationship is between two variables. However, it doesn’t give you a strong indication of how well the relationship explains the variability in the response variable, and it doesn’t work for more than two variables. There is a way to look at how much of the relationship explains the variability in the response variable.\nThere are many types of patterns one can see in the data. Common types of patterns are linear, exponential, logarithmic, or periodic. To see this pattern, you can draw a scatter plot of the data.This course will mostly deal with linear, but the other patterns exist.\nThere is some variability in the response variable values, such as calories. Some of the variation in calories is due to alcohol content and some is due to other factors. How much of the variation in the calories is due to alcohol content?\nWhen considering this question, you want to look at how much of the variation in calories is explained by alcohol content and how much is explained by other variables. Realize that some of the changes in calories have to do with other ingredients. You can have two beers at the same alcohol content, but one beer has higher calories because of the other ingredients. Some variability is explained by the model and some variability is not explained. Together, both of these give the total variability. This is (total variation)=(explained variation)+(unexplained variation)\nThe proportion of the variation that is explained by the model is \\(R^2=\\frac{\\text{explained variation}}{\\text{total variation}}\\)\nThis is known as the coefficient of determination.\nTo find the coefficient of determination, on r Studio, the command is to first name the linear model to be something and then you can find the summary of that named linear model. The next example shows how to find this.\n\n11.2.1 Example: Find the coefficient of determination \\(R^2\\)\nHow well does the alcohol content of a beer explain the variability in the number of calories in 12-ounce beer? To determine this a sample of beer’s alcohol content and calories (Find Out How Many Calories in Beer?, 2019), is in Table 11.1.\n\n11.2.1.1 Solution\nState random variables\n\\(x\\) = alcohol content in the beer\n\\(y\\) = calories in 12 ounce beer\nFirst find and name the linear model, how about lm_out_beer, so you can refer to it. Then use the command\n\nlm_out_beer&lt;-lm(calories~alcohol, data=Beer) #creates the linear model and calls it lm_out_beer \nrsquared(lm_out_beer) #finds the rsquared of the linear model created.\n\n[1] 0.8164314\n\n\nThe \\(R^2=0.8164\\). Thus, 81.64% of the variation in calories is explained to the linear relationship between alcohol content and calories. The other 18.36% of the variation is due to other factors. A really good coefficient of determination has a very small, unexplained part. So this means you probably don’t need to look for a co-variate.\nThis is all you have to do to find how much of the variability in the response variable is explained by the linear model.\nIf you do want to talk about correlation, correlation is another measure of the strength of the linear relationship. The symbol for the coefficient correlation is \\(r\\). To find \\(r\\), it is the square root of \\(R^2\\). So \\(r=\\sqrt{R^2}\\). So all you need to do is take the square root of the answer you already found. The only thing is that when you take a square root of both sides of an equation you need the \\(\\pm\\) symbol. This is because you don’t know if you want the positive or negative root. However, remember to read graphs from left to right, the same as you read words. If the graph goes up the correlation is positive and if the graph goes down the correlation is negative. Just affix the correct sign to the \\(r\\) value. You can also use this command and r will give you the correct sign.\ncor(respose_variable~explanatory_variable, data=Data_Frame)\nThe linear correlation coefficient is a number that describes the strength of the linear relationship between the two variables. It is also called the Pearson correlation coefficient after Karl Pearson who developed it.\n\n\n\n11.2.2 Interpretation of the correlation coefficient\n\\(r\\) is always between \\(-1\\) and 1. \\(r\\) = \\(-1\\) means there is a perfect negative linear correlation and \\(r\\) = 1 means there is a perfect positive correlation. The closer \\(r\\) is to 1 or \\(-1\\), the stronger the correlation. The closer \\(r\\) is to 0, the weaker the correlation. CAREFUL: \\(r\\) = 0 does not mean there is no correlation. It just means there is no linear correlation. There might be a very strong curved pattern.\n\n\n11.2.3 Example: Calculating the Linear Correlation Coefficient, \\(r\\)\nHow strong is the positive relationship between the alcohol content and the number of calories in 12-ounce beer? To determine if there is a linear correlation, a random sample was taken of beer’s alcohol content and calories for several different beers (\\“Calories in beer,,\\” 2011), and the Data Frame are in Table 11.1. Find the correlation coefficient and interpret that value.\n\n11.2.3.1 Solution\nState random variables\n\\(x\\) = alcohol content in the beer\n\\(y\\) = calories in 12 ounce beer\nFrom example 10.2.1, \\(R^2=0.8164\\). The correlation coefficient = \\(r=\\sqrt{r^2}=\\sqrt{0.8164}=0.9035486\\), or use this command in r\n\ncor(calories~alcohol, data=Beer)\n\n[1] 0.9035659\n\n\nThe scatter graph went up from left to right, so the correlation coefficient is positive. Since 0.90 is close to 1, then that means there is a fairly strong positive correlation.\n\n\n\n11.2.4 Causation\nOne common mistake people make is to assume that because there is a correlation, then one variable causes the other. This is usually not the case. That would be like saying the amount of alcohol in the beer causes it to have a certain number of calories. However, fermentation of sugars is what causes the alcohol content. The more sugars you have, the more alcohol can be made, and the more sugar, the higher the calories. It is actually the amount of sugar that causes both. Do not confuse the idea of correlation with the concept of causation. Just because two variables are correlated does not mean one causes the other to happen. However, the new theory is showing that if you have a relationship between two variables and a strong correlation, and you can show that there are no other variables that could explain the change, then you can show causation. This is how doctors have shown that smoking causes kidney cancer. Just realize that proving that one caused the other is a difficult process, and causation should not be just assumed.\n\n\n11.2.5 Example: Correlation Versus Causation\n\nA study showed a strong linear correlation between per capita beer consumption and teacher’s salaries. Does giving a teacher a raise cause people to buy more beer? Does buying more beer cause teachers to get a raise?\nA study shows that there is a correlation between people who have had a root canal and those that have cancer. Does that mean having a root canal causes cancer?\n\n\n11.2.5.1 Solution\n\nA study showed a strong linear correlation between per capita beer consumption and teacher’s salaries. Does giving a teacher a raise cause people to buy more beer? Does buying more beer cause teachers to get a raise?\nThere is probably some other factor causing both of them to increase at the same time. Think about this: In a town where people have little extra money, they won’t have money for beer and they won’t give teachers raises. In another town where people have more extra money to spend it will be easier for them to buy more beer and they would be more willing to give teachers raises.\n\n\n\nA study shows that there is a correlation between people who have had a root canal and those that have cancer. Does that mean having a root canal causes cancer?\nJust because there is positive correlation doesn’t mean that one caused the other. It turns out that there is a positive correlation between eating carrots and cancer, but that doesn’t mean that eating carrots causes cancer. In other words, there are lots of relationships you can find between two variables, but that doesn’t mean that one caused the other.\n\nRemember a correlation only means a pattern exists. It does not mean that one variable causes the other variable to change.\n\n\n\n11.2.6 Homework for Correlation Section\nFor each problem, state the random variables.The Data Frame in this section are in section 10.1 and will be used in section 10.3.\n\nWhen an anthropologist finds skeletal remains, they need to figure out the height of the person.

    "text": "11.3 Inference for Regression and Correlation\nThe idea behind regression is to find an equation that relates the response variable to the explanatory variables, and then use that equation to predict values of the response variable from values of the explanatory variables. But how do you now how good that estimate is? First you need a measure of the variability in the estimate, called the standard error of the estimate. The definition of the standard error of the estimate is how much error is in the estimate from the regression equation.\nStandard Error of the Estimate formula \\(S_e=\\sum{(\\hat{y}-y)^2}\\)\nThis formula is hard to work with but luckily r Studio will calculate it for you. In fact the command has already been used, so this information is already found. The command is\nsummary(lm_out) #lm_out is the name you gave the linear model\n\n11.3.1 Example: Finding the Standard Error of the Estimate\nIs there a relationship between the alcohol content and the number of calories in 12-ounce beer? To determine if there is a sample of beer’s alcohol content and calories (Find Out How Many Calories in Beer?, 2019), in Table 11.1. Find the standard error of the estimate.\nCode book for data frame Beer is below Table 11.1.\n\n11.3.1.1 Solution\n\\(x\\) = alcohol content in the beer\n\\(y\\) = calories in 12 ounce beer\nFirst save the linear model with a name like lm_out_beer. Then use summary(lm_out_beer) to find the standard error of the estimate.\n\nlm_out_beer=lm(calories~alcohol, data=Beer) \nsummary(lm_out_beer)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = calories ~ alcohol, data = Beer)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-51.869 -11.421  -0.145  11.855  55.473 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(&gt;|t|)    \n(Intercept)   14.527      4.577   3.174  0.00171 ** \nalcohol     2672.359     84.478  31.634  &lt; 2e-16 ***\n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\nResidual standard error: 17.62 on 225 degrees of freedom\nMultiple R-squared:  0.8164,    Adjusted R-squared:  0.8156 \nF-statistic:  1001 on 1 and 225 DF,  p-value: &lt; 2.2e-16\n\n\nThe standard error of the estimate is the residual standard error in the output. So the standard error of the estimate for the number of calories in a beer related to alcohol content is \\(S_e=17.62\\)\n\n\n\n11.3.2 Prediction Interval\nUsing the regression equation you can predict the number of calories from the alcohol content. However, you only find one value. The problem is that beers vary a bit in calories even if they have the same alcohol content. It would be nice to have a range instead of a single value. The range is called a prediction interval.\n\n\n11.3.3 Prediction Interval for an Individual \\(y\\)\nGiven the fixed value \\(x\\), the prediction interval for an individual \\(y\\) is \\(\\hat{y}\\pm E\\) where \\(E\\) is the error of the estimate.\nr will produce the prediction interval for you. The process follows\nTo calculate the linear model. Note this may already been done.\nlm_out = lm(explanatory_variable~ response_variable)\nThe following will compute a prediction interval. For the prediction variable set to a particular value (put that value in place of the word value), at a particular C level (given as a decimal).\npredict(lm_out, newdata=list(prediction_variable = value), interval=“prediction”, level=C)\n\n\n11.3.4 Example \\#10.3.2: Find the Prediction Interval\nIs there a relationship between the alcohol content and the number of calories in 12-ounce beer? To determine if there is a sample of beer’s alcohol content and calories (Find Out How Many Calories in Beer?, 2019), in Table 11.1. Find a 95% prediction interval for the number of calories when the alcohol content is 7.0%. content and calories (\\“Calories in beer,,\\” 2011). The Data Frame is in Table 11.1.\n\n11.3.4.1 Solution\n\\(x\\) = alcohol content in the beer\n\\(y\\) = calories in 12 ounce beer\nComputing the prediction interval using r Studio\n\npredict(lm_out_beer, newdata=list(alcohol=0.07), interval = \"prediction\", level=0.95) \n\n       fit      lwr     upr\n1 201.5922 166.6664 236.518\n\n\nthe fit = 201.5922 is the number of calories in the beer when the alcohol content is 7.0%. The prediction interval is between the lower (lwr) and upper (upr). The prediction interval is 166.6664 and 236.528. That means that 95% of all beer that has 7.0% alcohol has between 167 and 237 calories.\n\n\n\n11.3.5 Hypothesis Test for Correlation or Slope:\nHow do you really say you have a correlation or a linear relationship? Can you test to see if there really is a correlation or linear relationship? Of course, the answer is yes. The hypothesis test for correlation is as follows.\n\nState the random variables in words.\n\n\\(x\\) = explanatory variable\n\\(y\\) = response variable\n\nState the null and alternative hypotheses and the level of significance\n\n\\(H_o: \\text{there is not a correlation or linear relationship}\\)\n\\(H_a: \\text{there is a correlation or linear relationship}\\)\nAlso, state your \\(\\alpha\\) level here.\n\nState and check the conditions for the hypothesis test\n\nThe conditions for the hypothesis test are the same conditions for regression and correlation.\n\nFind the test statistic and p-value\n\nThe test statistic and p-value is already in the summary(lm_out) output.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis is where you write reject \\(H_o\\) or fail to reject \\(H_o\\). The rule is: if the p-value \\(&lt;\\alpha\\), then reject \\(H_o\\). If the p-value \\(\\ge \\alpha\\), then fail to reject \\(H_o\\)\n\nInterpretation\n\nThis is where you interpret in real world terms the conclusion to the test. The conclusion for a hypothesis test is that you either have enough evidence to support \\(H_a\\), or you do not have enough evidence to support \\(H_a\\).\n\n\n11.3.6 Example: Testing the Claim of a Linear Correlation\nIs there a linear relationship, or correlation, between the alcohol content and the number of calories in 12-ounce beer? To determine if there is a sample of beer’s alcohol content and calories (Find Out How Many Calories in Beer?, 2019), in Table 11.1. Test at the 5% level.\n\n11.3.6.1 Solution\n\nState the random variables in words.\n\n\\(x\\) = alcohol content in the beer\n\\(y\\) = calories in 12 ounce beer\n\nState the null and alternative hypotheses and the level of significance\n\n\\(H_o: \\text{there is not a correlation or linear relationship}\\)\n\\(H_a: \\text{there is a correlation or linear relationship}\\)\nlevel of significance \\(\\alpha=0.05\\)\n\nState and check the conditions for the hypothesis test\n\nThe conditions for the hypothesis test were already checked in Example: Find the Equation of the Regression Line\n\nFind the test statistic and p-value\n\nThe command on r Studio is\n\nlm_out_beer&lt;-lm(calories~alcohol, data=Beer) \nsummary(lm_out_beer)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = calories ~ alcohol, data = Beer)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-51.869 -11.421  -0.145  11.855  55.473 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

In this case that is 31.634. The p-value is the Pr(&gt;|t|) which is \\(2.2X10^{-16}\\).\n\nConclusion\n\nReject \\(H_o\\) since the p-value is less than 0.05.\n\nInterpretation\n\nThere is enough evidence to show that there is a correlation and linear relationship between alcohol content and number of calories in a 12-ounce bottle of beer.\n\n\n\n11.3.7 Homework for Inference for Regression and Correlation Section\nFor each problem, state the random variables.
