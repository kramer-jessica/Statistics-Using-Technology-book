The previous chapter looked at comparing populations to see if there is a difference between the two. That involved two random variables that are similar measures. This chapter will look at two random variables that do not need to be similar measures, and see if there is a relationship between the two or more variables. To do this, you look at regression, which finds the linear relationship, and correlation, which measures the strength of a linear relationship.

Please note: there are many other types of relationships besides linear that can be found for the data. This book will only explore linear, but realize that there are other relationships that can be used to describe data.

## Regression

When comparing different variables, two questions come to mind: "Is there a relationship between two variables?" and "How strong is that relationship?" These questions can be answered using **regression** and **correlation**. Regression answers whether there is a relationship, (again this book will explore linear relationships only) and correlation answers how strong the linear relationship is. The variable that is used to explain the change (or variability) in the other variable is called the **explanatory variable** or **predictor variable**, while the variable whose variability is being explained is called the **response variable**. In general, variables that help to explain the changes in a response variable are known as **covariates**. To introduce the concepts of regression and correlation, it is easier to look at a set of data.

### Example: Determining if there is a Relationship

Is there a relationship between the alcohol content and the number of calories in 12-ounce beer? To determine if there is one, we explore a dataset of 227 beers, including their alcohol content and their calorie counts (Find Out How Many Calories in Beer?, 2019). @tbl-Beer shows the first five rows of the dataset.

**Description** Collection of the most popular beers from large breweries. The data is of the calories, carbs and alcohol of a specific beer. The data is shown for a 12 ounce serving. The collection includes both domestic and import beer. For the imported beers the information is per 12 oz. serving even though many imports come in pints.

This dataset contains the following columns:

[beer]{.var}: The name of the beer.

[brewery]{.var}: the brewery that brews the beer.

[location]{.var}: whether the beer is brewed in the U.S. (domestic) or brewed in another country (import).

[alcohol]{.var}: the alcohol content of the beer.

[calories]{.var}: the number of calories in the beer.

[carbs]{.var}: the amount of carbohydrates in the beer (g).

#### Solution

To aid in figuring out if there is a relationship, it helps to draw a scatterplot of the data. First, it is helpful to state the variables, and since variables in an algebra class are typically represented as $x$ and $y$, those labels will be used here. It helps to state which variable is $x$ (explanatory or predictor) and which is $y$ (response).

State variables

$x$ = alcohol content in the beer

$y$ = calories in 12 ounce beer

The scatter plot shown in @fig-Beer-point looks fairly linear.

To find the equation for the linear relationship, the process of regression is used to determine the line that best fits the data (sometimes called the best-fitting line). The process is to draw a line through the data and measure the vertical distance from each point to the line. These distances are called the **residuals**. The regression line is the line that makes the sum of the square of the residuals as small as possible, which is why it is sometimes called the least squares line. The regression line on the scatter plot is displayed in @fig-Beer-point-line.

### Find the regression equation (also known as best fitting line or least squares line)

Given a collection of paired sample data, the regression equation is $\hat{y}=mx+b$, where the slope = $m$ and $y$-intercept = $(0,b)$.

As we will show, to find the linear model using Rguroo, we use the [Linear Regression]{.fun} function in the **Analytics** toolbox. 

The **residuals** are the difference between the actual observed values of the response and the corresponding estimated (predicted) values, namely $\text{residual} = y - \hat{y}$.

The **independent variable** (the $x$-value) corresponds to the **explanatory** or **predictor** variable, the variable used to predict or explain changes in another variable. The **dependent variable** (the $y$-value) corresponds to the **response** variable—the variable whose values change in relation to the predictor. In our example, alcohol content is the predictor (independent, $x$) variable, and the number of calories is the response (dependent, $y$) variable, since it makes more sense to predict calories from alcohol content rather than vice versa.

::: {#assumption-validity-line .ref-label} :::

**Assumptions for the Validity of the Regression Equation and Line:**

1. _Randomness_: The set of ordered pairs is a random sample from the population of all such possible pairs.

2. _Linearity_: For a given $x$-value, the distribution of $y$-values has a mean that lies on the least squares line.

The assumption of linearity is essential. If the relationship between the two variables is not linear, then a regression line will not fit the data well. To check linearity, we look at the scatterplot: a roughly straight-line pattern suggests the assumption is reasonable, while a curved pattern suggests it is not. We can also examine the so called residual-versus-fit plot. If the residuals are randomly scattered around the horizontal line $y = 0$ on this plot, the linearity assumption is likely valid. If the residuals show a curved pattern, then the assumption of linearity is likely violated.


::: {#assumption-validity-inference .ref-label} :::

**Assumptions for the validity of inference:** 

3. _Constant Variance_: The variance of the $y$-values should be the same across all $x$-values. 

4. _Normality_: The $y$-values for each fixed value of $x$ should follow a normal distribution.

The assumptions of constant variance and normality are primarily needed for the validity of inference in regression. Inference includes procedures such as constructing confidence intervals and carrying out hypothesis tests. Just as with the confidence intervals and hypothesis tests for means and proportions that you are already familiar with, we can construct confidence intervals and tests of hypotheses for the slope and intercept of the regression line, as well as for predicted values $\hat{y}$.
 

Although this book does not cover inference for regression, it is helpful to understand the basic ideas behind the underlying assumptions. To check the constant-variance, we examine the residual-versus-fit plot: if the residuals are scattered with roughly the same vertical spread around the horizontal line $y = 0$ across all fitted-values, the assumption is reasonable. A funnel-shaped pattern suggests that unequal variances. 

To check normality, we look at a histogram or a *normal probability plot* of the residuals. The histogram should appear bell-shaped, and in a normal probability plot the residuals should fall roughly along a straight line; pronounced curvature or outliers indicate that the normality assumption may not be satisfied.

### Example: Find the Equation of the Regression Line

Is there a relationship between the alcohol content and the number of calories in 12-ounce beer? To determine if there is one, we examine the sample of beer's alcohol content and calories, portion of which is shown in @tbl-Beer (Find Out How Many Calories in Beer?, 2019).

a.  Find the regression equation between alcohol content and calories.
b.  Use the regression equation to find the number of calories when the alcohol content is 7%.
c.  Use the regression equation to find the number of calories when the alcohol content is 14%.

#### Solution

a.  Find the regression equation between alcohol content and calories.

State random variables

$x$ = alcohol content in the beer

$y$ = calories in 12 ounce beer

This table shows various information about the regression analysis. In particular, the last row, labeled “Equation of Least Squares Line,” gives the estimates for the slope and the $y$-intercept. Note that the equation states *calories* in place of $y$ and *alcohol* in place of $x$.

From this, rounding the values,  you can see that the y-intercept is 14.5 and the slope is 2672.4. So the regression equation is $\hat{y}=2672.4x+14.5$.

Remember, this is an estimate for the true regression equation. A different sample would produce a different estimate.

Conditions check:

1.  _Randomness_: A random sample of alcohol content and calories was taken.

    Check: There is no guarantee that this was a random sample. The data was collected off of a website, and the website does not say how the data was obtained. However, it is a collection of most popular beers from large breweries, so it may be alright that it isn't a random sample.

2. _Linearity_: For a given $x$-value, the distribution of $y$-values has a mean that lies on the least squares line.

Check:

We examine two graphs to check this condition: the scatter plot of $y$ versus $x$ and the residual-versus-fit plot.

i. @fig-Beer-point shows the scatterplot of calories versus alcohol content. This graph is also shown as part of the default output of the [Linear Regression]{.fun} function in Rguroo. This scatterplot looks fairly linear, so this condition appears to be satisfied.

ii.  @fig-Beer-resvsfit shows the residual-versus-fit plot, which is also part of the [Linear Regression]{.fun} function output in Rguroo. The points on this plot are obtained by calculating the fitted values and the residuals for each data point. For each $x$-value, a predicted value for $y$ is computed using the equation of the least squares line; this predicted value is called the *fitted value* and is denoted by $\hat{y}$. The residual is then found by subtracting the fitted value from the observed $y$-value: 

$$
\mbox{residual} = y - \hat{y}.
$$
Fortunately, Rguroo calculates these automatically for you.

To check this assumption, we examine the normal probability plot of the residuals shown in @fig-Beer-QQ, which is also part of the [Linear Regression]{.fun} function output in Rguroo. In this plot, the residuals fall roughly along a straight line, so this condition appears to be satisfied. More specifically, all points lie within the confidence bands ( shown as red dotted curves), and there is no pronounced curvature or outliers.

b.  Use the regression equation to find the number of calories when the alcohol content is 7.00%.

To make a prediction, we substitute the given alcohol content (expressed as a decimal) into the regression equation and compute the corresponding fitted value. In this example, we want to predict the number of calories for a beer with 7.00% alcohol content. Since 7.00% expressed as a decimal is 0.07, we substitute $x = 0.07$ into the regression equation:
$$
\hat{y} = 2672 \times 0.07 + 14.3 = 201.34.
$$
This value, 201.34, is the predicted number of calories for a beer whose alcohol content is 7\%. So, if you are drinking a beer that has 7.00\% alcohol content, then it probably has close to 200 calories.

Considering all the data, the mean number of calories is 154.5. However, for beers with 7\% alcohol content, the predicted value of 201 calories is a more appropriate estimate because the beers in the dataset with 7\% alcohol all have between 160 and 231 calories. In this case, the regression equation provides a better estimate than simply using the overall mean.

c.  Use the regression equation to find the number of calories when the alcohol content is 14%.

$$\hat{y}=2672*0.14+14.3=388.38$$

You can obtain predicted values in Rguroo. For example, to get the predicted values for alcohol contents of 7.00% and 14.00%, enter 0.07 and 0.14 (separated by a comma) in the textbox labeled [Predict at new x value(s)]{.des} in the [Simple Linear Regression]{.diag} dialog in Rguroo, as shown in @fig-AlcoholCalorieRegress_pred below.

#| out-width: "70%"
knitr::include_graphics(
  "Rguroo_dialogs/Regression/AlcoholCalorieRegress_pred.png")
```


The predicted values output from Rguroo is shown in @fig-AlcoholCaloriePredOutput below.

```{r AlcoholCaloriePredOutput, echo=FALSE}
#| fig-alt: "Rguroo output showing predicted calories for alcohol contents of 7.00% and 14.00%"

#| out-width: "70%"
knitr::include_graphics(
  "Rguroo_outputs/Regression/AlcoholCaloriePredOutput.png")
```


If you are drinking a beer that is 14% alcohol content, then it probably has close to 388 calories. Since, on average, a 12% alcohol beer has 330 calories, you might expect a 14% beer to have more calories than this. However, the maximum alcohol content in our dataset is 12%. The estimate for a 14% beer is therefore an example of **extrapolation**, because it is a prediction for an $x$-value outside the range of the data used to fit the model. It is not a good idea to predict values that fall far outside the range of the original data, because we cannot be sure that the regression relationship remains valid beyond the observed $x$-values.

Notice that 7.00% alcohol is within the range of the original $x$-values. Predicting a value for an $x$-value inside the observed range is called **interpolation**. The 14.00% value is outside that range, and predicting for an $x$-value outside the original data is called **extrapolation**. When you interpolate, you can usually feel confident that the predicted value will be close to the true value because the model was created using data within that range and is intended to describe relationships only there. When you extrapolate, however, you cannot be sure the prediction is close to the true value, because the relationship may change for $x$-values beyond those observed when the model was created.

<!-- Discuss: The following example is not clear and its relationship to linear regression is not clear. . So I replaced it.

Another example of extrapolation is when you use regression to come up with an equation to predict the growth of a city, like Flagstaff, AZ. Based on analysis it was determined that the population of Flagstaff would be well over 50,000 by 1995. However, when a census was undertaken in 1995, the population was less than 50,000. This is because they extrapolated and the growth factor they were using had obviously changed from the early 1990's. Growth factors can change for many reasons, such as employment growth, employment stagnation, disease, articles saying great place to live, etc. Realize that when you extrapolate, your predicted value may not be anywhere close to the actual value that you observe.
-->

Another example of extrapolation is the relationship between age and height.
This relationship is approximately linear only during middle childhood,
roughly between ages 2 and 10. Suppose we model height (in inches) as a
linear function of age (in years) using the equation

Height = 30 + 2.5 × Age.

For example, to predict the height of a child who is 6 years old
(an interpolation because 6 is within the 2–10 range), we substitute Age = 6:

Height = 30 + 2.5 × 6 = 45 inches.

However, using the same model to predict height at age 30 represents an
extrapolation, since age 30 is far outside the range where the linear
relationship holds. Substituting Age = 30 gives:

Height = 30 + 2.5 × 30 = 105 inches,

a clearly unrealistic value. This illustrates why extrapolation can lead
to misleading conclusions.


What does the slope mean in the context of this problem?

The calories increase by 26.72 for every 1% increase in alcohol content.

The $y$-intercept in many cases is meaningless. In this case, it means that if a drink has 0 alcohol content, then it would have 14.3 calories which maybe a reasonable value. However, consider the model for height versus age discussed above. The $y$-intercept is 30 inches, which would be the predicted height of a newborn baby (age 0). This is not a reasonable value since newborn babies are typically about 20 inches long. So in this case, the $y$-intercept is not meaningful. 

<!-- Revised: This may be reasonable, but remember this value is an extrapolation so it may be wrong. (Mynote: actually it is not an extrapolation since 0% is within the range of possible alcohol content)

Consider the residuals again. According to the data, a beer with 7.0% alcohol has between 160 and 231 calories. The predicted value is 201 calories. This variation means that the actual value was between 40 calories below and 30 calories above the predicted value. That isn't that far off. Some of the actual values differ by a large amount from the predicted value. This is due to variability in the response variable. The larger the residuals the less the model explains the variability in the response variable. There needs to be a way to calculate how well the model explains the variability in the response variable. This will be explored in the next section.

One last thing that you may wonder is if imported beer has a different number of calories than domestic beer. The location (imported versus domestic) is a covariate, a third variable that may affects the calorie content. A covariate that is a categorical variable is referred to as a **factor**. You can create a scatterplot that  displays the data separately for each category of this covariate (factor).

**Description** Variation in gasoline mileage among makes and models of automobiles is influenced substantially by the weight and horsepower of the vehicles. When miles per gallon and horsepower are transformed to logarithms, the linearity of the regression is improved. A negative second order term is required to fit the logarithmic mileage to weight relation. If the logged variables are standardized, the coefficients of the first order terms indicate the standard units change in log mileage per one standard unit change in the predictor variable at the (logarithmic) mean. This change is constant in the case of mileage to horsepower, but not for mileage to weight. The coefficient of the second order weight term indicates the change in standardized slope associated with a one standard deviation increase in the logarithm of weight.

## Correlation 

<!-- Rewrote this section to explain correlation more and how to find it in Rguroo. Also have a smooth transition to R^2 -->

A correlation exists between two variables when the values of one variable are associated with the values of the other variable. Correlation is a word used in everyday life, and many people think they understand what it means. What it really means, when stated as a number, is a measure of how strong the linear relationship is between two variables. This measure is called the **correlation coefficient**, or **correlation** for short. It is also called the **Pearson correlation coefficient** after Karl Pearson who developed it. There are many types of patterns (relationships) between variables that one can see in data. Common types of patterns are linear, exponential, logarithmic, or periodic. To see these patterns, you can draw a scatterplot of the data. In this chapter, and generally in this course, we mostly deal with linear relationships.

### Interpretation of the correlation coefficient

The correlation coefficient is a number between −1 and 1 and is usually denoted by the letter $r$. A value of $r = 1$ indicates a perfect positive linear relationship, and a value of $r = -1$ indicates a perfect negative linear relationship. A perfect linear relationship means that all of the data points lie exactly on a straight line.

The strength of the linear relationship depends on how close $r$ is to 1 or −1. Values of $r$ close to these extremes indicate a strong linear relationship, while values closer to 0 indicate a weaker linear relationship. A correlation of $r = 0$ means there is no linear relationship between the two variables.

The sign of $r$ describes the direction of the relationship. A positive correlation means that as one variable increases, the other variable tends to increase. A negative correlation means that as one variable increases, the other variable tends to decrease.

<!--
$r$ is always between $-1$ and 1. $r$ = $-1$ means there is a perfect negative linear correlation and $r$ = 1 means there is a perfect positive correlation. The closer $r$ is to 1 or $-1$, the stronger the correlation. The closer $r$ is to 0, the weaker the correlation. CAREFUL: $r$ = 0 does not mean there is no correlation. It just means there is **no linear correlation**. There might be a very strong curved pattern.
-->


### Example: Calculating the Linear Correlation Coefficient, $r$

How strong is the positive relationship between alcohol content and the number of calories in a 12-ounce beer? To answer this question, compute the correlation between alcohol content and calories using the [beer]{.data} dataset (“Calories in Beer,” 2011). The first six rows of this dataset are shown in @tbl-Beer. Use Rguroo to find the correlation coefficient and then interpret its value.

#### Solution

You can obtain the correlation coefficient, $r$, in Rguroo from the output of the [Linear Regression]{.fun} function. To obtain this value for the beer example, follow the steps for creating a linear regression model [here](#Finding-the-Regression-Equation-in-Rguroo).

For these data the correlation coefficient between alcohol content and calories is 0.9036. This value appears in the _Data and Model Summary_ table of the regression function output in the row labeled [Pearson Correlation (r)]{.des}; see @tbl-Beer-lm-model, and it indicates a strong positive linear relationship between alcohol content and calories, since the value of $r$ is close to 1. Also, since $r$ is positive, it means that as alcohol content increases, the number of calories tends to increase as well.

<!--
State random variables

$x$ = alcohol content in the beer

$y$ = calories in 12 ounce beer

From example 10.2.1, $R^2=0.8164$. The correlation coefficient = $r=\sqrt{r^2}=\sqrt{0.8164}=0.9035486$, or use this command in r

```{r}
cor(calories~alcohol, data=Beer)
```

The scatter graph went up from left to right, so the correlation coefficient is positive. Since 0.90 is close to 1, then that means there is a fairly strong positive correlation.

<!-- However, it doesn't give you a strong indication of how well the relationship explains the variability in the response variable, and it doesn't work for more than two variables. There is a way to look at how much of the relationship explains the variability in the response variable.
-->

### Coefficient of Determination, $R^2$

Correlation is related to another measure that explains how much of the variability in the response variable is explained by the explanatory variable. The variability in a response variable can be due to many factors. Some of the variability is explained by the explanatory variable and some is due to other factors. For example, in the beer example, some of the variability in calories is explained by alcohol content and some is due to other factors, such as other ingredients in the beer. There is a way to measure how much of the variability in the response variable is explained by the explanatory variable. This measure is called the **coefficient of determination**, denoted by $R^2$ (read R-squared), and its value is the square of the correlation.

<!-- There is some variability in the response variable values, such as calories. Some of the variation in calories is due to alcohol content and some is due to other factors. How much of the variation in the calories is due to alcohol content?
-->

As an example, using the beer data, we want to understand how much of the variation in calories is explained by alcohol content and how much is due to other factors, such as ingredients. For instance, two beers can have the same alcohol content but different numbers of calories because they contain different ingredients. A linear regression of calories on alcohol content explains the part of the variation in calories that is associated with alcohol content. The remaining variation is due to other factors and random differences between beers, and is not explained by the regression. Together, the explained and unexplained parts account for all of the variability in calories:

(total variation) = (explained variation) + (unexplained variation)

The proportion of the variation that is explained by the model is $R^2=\frac{\text{explained variation}}{\text{total variation}}$.

This is known as the **coefficient of determination**.

### Example: Find the coefficient of determination $R^2$

How well does the alcohol content of a beer explain the variability in the number of calories in 12-ounce beer? To determine this, use the sample of beer's alcohol content and calories (Find Out How Many Calories in Beer?, 2019) in the [beer]{.data} dataset. The first six rows of this dataset is shown in @tbl-Beer.

#### Solution

You can obtain the coefficient of determination, $R^2$, in Rguroo from the output of the [Linear Regression]{.fun} function. To obtain the coefficient of determination for the beer example, follow the steps for creating a linear regression model [here](#Finding-the-Regression-Equation-in-Rguroo).

For these data, the coefficient of determination between alcohol content and calories is 0.8164. This value appears in the _Data and Model Summary_ table of the regression function output in the row labeled [Coefficient of Determination (R-squared)]{.des}; see @tbl-Beer-lm-model. This value indicates that 81.64% of the variability in calories is explained by alcohol content, while the remaining 18.36% is due to other factors.

A high coefficient of determination (for example, above 0.8) means that only a small portion of the variability is unexplained. In this situation, alcohol content alone explains most of the variability in calories, so there may be little need to include additional explanatory variables to improve the model.

<!--

State random variables

$x$ = alcohol content in the beer

$y$ = calories in 12 ounce beer

First find and name the linear model, how about lm_out_beer, so you can refer to it. Then use the command

```{r chapter-10-beer-lm, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
lm_out_beer<-lm(calories~alcohol, data=Beer) #creates the linear model and calls it lm_out_beer 
rsquared(lm_out_beer) #finds the rsquared of the linear model created.
```

The $R^2=0.8164$. Thus, 81.64% of the variation in calories is explained to the linear relationship between alcohol content and calories. The other 18.36% of the variation is due to other factors. 

This is all you have to do to find how much of the variability in the response variable is explained by the linear model.

-->

There is a relationship between correlation coefficient $r$ and the coefficient of determination $R^2$, namely $r = \pm\sqrt{R^2}$.
The question is which sign, plus ($+$) or minus ($-$), should be used. If the relationship is positive (that is, the slope of the regression line is positive), use the $+$ sign. If the relationship is negative (the slope is negative), use the $-$ sign. In other words, assign to $r$ the same sign as the slope of the linear regression line.

<!--
You can also use this command and r will give you the correct sign.

cor(respose_variable\~explanatory_variable, data=Data_Frame)

The **linear correlation coefficient** is a number that describes the strength of the linear relationship between the two variables. It is also called the Pearson correlation coefficient after Karl Pearson who developed it.

-->

### Causation

One common mistake people make is to assume that because there is a correlation between two variables, then one variable causes the other. This is usually not the case. That would be like saying the amount of alcohol in the beer causes it to have a certain number of calories. However, fermentation of sugars is what causes the alcohol content. The more sugars you have, the more alcohol can be made, and the more sugar, the higher the calories. It is actually the amount of sugar that causes both. Do not confuse the idea of correlation with the concept of causation. Just because two variables are correlated does not mean one causes the other to happen. However, the new theory is showing that if you have a relationship between two variables and a strong correlation, and you can show that there are no other variables that could explain the change, then you can show causation. This is how doctors have shown that smoking causes kidney cancer. Just realize that proving that one caused the other is a difficult process, and causation should not be just assumed.

### Example: Correlation Versus Causation

<!--We probably should reconsider these two examples.-->

a.  A study showed a strong linear correlation between per capita beer consumption and teacher's salaries. Does giving a teacher a raise cause people to buy more beer? Does buying more beer cause teachers to get a raise?

There is probably some other factor causing both of them to increase at the same time. Think about this: In a town where people have little extra money, they won't have money for beer and they won't give teachers raises. In another town where people have more extra money to spend it will be easier for them to buy more beer and they would be more willing to give teachers raises.

b.  A study shows that there is a correlation between people who have had a root canal and those that have cancer. Does that mean having a root canal causes cancer?

Just because there is positive correlation doesn't mean that one caused the other. It turns out that there is a positive correlation between eating carrots and cancer, but that doesn't mean that eating carrots causes cancer. In other words, there are lots of relationships you can find between two variables, but that doesn't mean that one caused the other.

Remember a correlation only means a pattern exists. It does not mean that one variable causes the other variable to change.

## Inference for Regression and Correlation

The idea behind regression is to find an equation that relates the response variable to the explanatory variables, and then use that equation to predict values of the response variable from values of the explanatory variables. But how do you know how good that estimate is?

When we use a regression equation to make a prediction, the predicted value is only a single number. In practice, however, there is almost always some uncertainty in that prediction. Even if we knew the true relationship between the variables, individual observations would still vary around that relationship due to natural randomness and factors not included in the model.

Because of this variability, it is usually more informative to give a range of plausible values for the response variable rather than a single predicted value. A prediction interval provides such a range. It gives an interval of values that is likely to contain the response value for a new observation with specified explanatory variable values, along with a stated level of confidence.

<!-- I am removing computation of standard error since students do not use this for anything in their computations. We will focus on obtaining prediction intervals. 
 First you need a measure of the variability in the estimate, called the standard error of the estimate. The definition of the **standard error of the estimate** is how much error is in the estimate from the regression equation.

**Standard Error of the Estimate** formula $S_e=\sum{(\hat{y}-y)^2}$

This formula is hard to work with but luckily r Studio will calculate it for you. In fact the command has already been used, so this information is already found. The command is

summary(lm_out) #lm_out is the name you gave the linear model

### Example: Finding the Standard Error of the Estimate

Is there a relationship between the alcohol content and the number of calories in 12-ounce beer? To determine if there is a sample of beer's alcohol content and calories (Find Out How Many Calories in Beer?, 2019), in @tbl-Beer. Find the standard error of the estimate.

**Code book for data frame Beer is below @tbl-Beer.**

#### Solution

$x$ = alcohol content in the beer

$y$ = calories in 12 ounce beer

First save the linear model with a name like lm_out_beer. Then use summary(lm_out_beer) to find the standard error of the estimate.

```{r chapter-10-beer-lm-out}
lm_out_beer=lm(calories~alcohol, data=Beer) 
summary(lm_out_beer)
```

The standard error of the estimate is the residual standard error in the output. So the standard error of the estimate for the number of calories in a beer related to alcohol content is $S_e=17.62$

-->

### Prediction Interval

Using the regression equation you can predict the number of calories from the alcohol content. However, you only find one value. The problem is that beers vary a bit in calories even if they have the same alcohol content. It would be nice to have a range instead of a single value. The range is called a prediction interval.

### Prediction Interval for an Individual $y$

Given the fixed value $x$, a prediction interval for the response at $x$ is $\hat{y}\pm E$ where $\hat{y}$ is the predicted value from the regression equation and $E$ is the margin of error for the prediction.

Rguroo will calculate the prediction interval for you in the [Linear Regression]{.fun} function. You just have to give it the value of $x$ that you want to predict for, and tell it you want a prediction interval.

### Example: Find the Prediction Interval

Is there a relationship between the alcohol content and the number of calories in 12-ounce beer?
To determine this, use the sample of beer's alcohol content and calories (Find Out How Many Calories in Beer?, 2019) in the [beer]{.data} dataset. The first six rows of this dataset is shown in @tbl-Beer. Find a 95% prediction interval for the number of calories when the alcohol content is 7.0%.

#### Solution

To obtain the prediction interval for the beer example, follow the steps for creating a linear regression model [here](#Finding-the-Regression-Equation-in-Rguroo). Additionally, in the [linear Regression]{.fun} dialog box, enter the value of alcohol content (0.07) in the textbox labeled [Predict at new x value(s)]{.des}. Then click the tab labeled [Prediction Interval]{.des} and select the checkboxes labeled [Prediction Interval]{.des}. These steps are shown in @fig-AlcoholCalorieRegress_pred_interval. 

```{r AlcoholCalorieRegress_pred_interval, echo=FALSE}
#| fig-alt: "Rguroo dialog for obtaining prediction interval for calories from alcohol content"
#| warning: FALSE
#| label: fig-AlcoholCalorieRegress_pred_interval
#| fig-cap: "Rguroo dialog for obtaining prediction interval for calories from alcohol content"
#| out-width: "70%"
knitr::include_graphics(
  "Rguroo_dialogs/Regression/AlcoholCalorieRegress_pred_interval.png")
```

The output containing the prediction interval is shown in @fig-Beer-pred-interval.

```{r Beer-pred-interval, echo=FALSE}
#| fig-alt: "Rguroo output showing prediction interval for calories from alcohol content"
#| warning: FALSE
#| label: fig-Beer-pred-interval
#| fig-cap: "Rguroo output showing prediction interval for calories from alcohol content"
#| out-width: "85%"
knitr::include_graphics(
  "Rguroo_outputs/Regression/Beer-pred-interval.png")  
```

<!---
$x$ = alcohol content in the beer

$y$ = calories in 12 ounce beer

Computing the prediction interval using r Studio

```{r chapter-10-beer-predict, eval = FALSE, echo=FALSE}
predict(lm_out_beer, newdata=list(alcohol=0.07), interval = "prediction", level=0.95) 
```

--->

The value 201.592 is the model’s predicted number of calories for a beer with 7.0% alcohol. The prediction interval is shown in the columns labeled _Lower Pred Limit (2.5%)_ and _Upper Pred Limit (97.5%)_. This means we can be 95% confident that the actual number of calories for a beer with 7.0% alcohol lies between 166.7 and 236.5. This range is called a 95% prediction interval.

You can obtain prediction intervals for other alcohol contents by entering different values in the textbox labeled [Predict at new x value(s)]{.des} in the [Linear Regression]{.fun} dialog box. You can also change the confidence level using the textbox labeled [Confidence Level]{.des} in the [Confidence Interval]{.des} tab.

### Hypothesis Test for Correlation or Slope:

How do we decide whether there is really a correlation or a linear relationship between two variables? Can we test whether such a relationship exists? The answer is yes. We can test for correlation, or we can test whether the slope of the regression line is zero.

These two tests are equivalent. If there is a correlation between the variables, then the slope of the regression line is not zero. Likewise, if the slope of the regression line is not zero, then there is a correlation between the variables. For this reason, testing for correlation and testing for slope lead to the same conclusion.

The steps for performing a hypothesis test for correlation are given below. You can use these steps to test for correlation or to test whether the slope is zero.

1.  State the variables in words.

  $x$ = explanatory variable

  $y$ = response variable

2.  State the null and alternative hypotheses and the level of significance

$H_o: \text{there is not a correlation}$

$H_a: \text{there is a correlation}$

Or equivalently

$H_o: \text{the slope is zero}$

$H_a: \text{the slope is not zero}$

Also, state $\alpha$, the significance level for your test.

3.  State and check the conditions for the hypothesis test, as explained in the sections [Assumptions for Validity of the Regression Equation and Line](#assumption-validity-line) and [Assumptions for Validity of Inference](#assumption-validity-inference).

4.  Find the test statistic and p-value

This will be calculated by Rguroo.

5.  Conclusion

This is where you write reject $H_o$ or fail to reject $H_o$. The rule is: if the p-value $<\alpha$, then reject $H_o$. If the p-value $\ge \alpha$, then fail to reject $H_o$

6.  Interpretation

This is where you interpret in real world terms the conclusion to the test. The conclusion for a hypothesis test is that you either have enough evidence to support $H_a$, or you do not have enough evidence to support $H_a$.

### Example: Testing the Claim of a Linear Correlation

Is there a linear relationship, or correlation, between the alcohol content and the number of calories in 12-ounce beer? To determine this, use the sample of beer's alcohol content and calories (Find Out How Many Calories in Beer?, 2019) in the [beer]{.data} dataset. The first six rows of this dataset is shown in @tbl-Beer. Test at the 5% level.

#### Solution

1.  State the random variables in words.

$x$ = alcohol content in the beer

$y$ = calories in 12 ounce beer

2.  State the null and alternative hypotheses and the level of significance

$H_o: \text{there is not a correlation}$

$H_a: \text{there is a correlation}$

level of significance $\alpha=0.05$

3.  State and check the conditions for the hypothesis test

The conditions for the hypothesis test were already checked in [Example: Find the Equation of the Regression Line]

4.  Find the test statistic and p-value

To obtain the test statistic and p-value, follow the steps for creating a linear regression model [here](#Finding-the-Regression-Equation-in-Rguroo). Additionally, in the [linear Regression]{.fun} dialog box, under the [Test of Association]{.des} tab, check the box labeled [Slope]{.des}, and under the **method** section select [Theoretical t-statistic]{.des}. These steps are shown in @fig-AlcoholCalorieRegress_test. The default value for the significance level is 0.05, so you do not need to change that value. However, if you want to change it, you can do so in the textbox labeled [Significance Level]{.des}.

```{r AlcoholCalorieRegress_test, echo=FALSE}
#| fig-alt: "Rguroo dialog for testing slope for calories from alcohol content"
#| warning: FALSE
#| label: fig-AlcoholCalorieRegress_test
#| fig-cap: "Rguroo dialog for testing slope for calories from alcohol content"
#| out-width: "70%"
knitr::include_graphics(
  "Rguroo_dialogs/Regression/AlcoholCalorieRegress_test.png")

```

The output containing the result of the test shown in @fig-AlcoholCalorieRegress_test_out.

```{r AlcoholCalorieRegress_test_out, echo=FALSE}
#| fig-alt: "Result of Rguroo hypothesis test for slope for calories from alcohol content"
#| warning: FALSE
#| label: fig-AlcoholCalorieRegress_test_out
#| fig-cap: "AlcoholCalorieRegress_test_out"
#| out-width: "85%"
knitr::include_graphics(
  "Rguroo_outputs/Regression/AlcoholCalorieRegress_test_out.png")
  
```

```{r chapter-10-beer-test, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
lm_out_beer<-lm(calories~alcohol, data=Beer) 
summary(lm_out_beer)
```

The test statistic is the t value in the column labeled _Obs t Stat_. In this case the t-statistic is 31.634, and the p-value id $8.84X10^{-85}$.

5.  Conclusion

Reject $H_o$ since the p-value is less than 0.05.

6.  Interpretation

There is enough evidence to show that there is a correlation between alcohol content and number of calories in a 12-ounce bottle of beer.
