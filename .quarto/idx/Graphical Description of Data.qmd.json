Remember, in most cases you can't collect the entire population, so you have to take a sample. Thus, you collect data either through a sample or a census. Now you have a large number of data values. What can you do with them? No one likes to look at just a set of numbers. One thing is to organize the data into a table or graph. Ultimately though, you want to be able to use that graph to interpret the data, to describe the distribution of the data set, and to explore different characteristics of the data. The characteristics that will be discussed in this chapter and the next chapter are:\n\n1.  Center: middle of the data set, also known as the average.\n2.  Variation: how much the data varies.\n3.  Distribution: shape of the data (symmetric, uniform, or skewed).\n4.  Qualitative data: analysis of the data\n5.  Outliers: data values that are far from the majority of the data.\n6.  Time: changing characteristics of the data over time.\n\nThis chapter will focus on organizing data, creating graphs of the data, and using the graphs to understand aspects of the data.\n\nThis textbook uses Rguroo to perform all graphical and descriptive statistics, and all statistical inference. When using Rguroo, you will need to either import a dataset from a repository or create a dataset. For directions on how to create a dataset in Rguroo, please refer to Chapter 0.\n\n```{r setup2, include=FALSE,echo=FALSE}\nlibrary(\"mosaicCore\") \nlibrary(\"mosaic\") \n#library(\"NHANES\") \nlibrary(\"Lock5Data\")\n```\n\n\nRemember, qualitative data are words describing a characteristic of the individual. Once you’ve gathered raw data, the real work begins. A long list of observations doesn’t tell you much on its own. Raw data is usually messy, unstructured, and difficult to understand or use. The next step is to organize the data in a way that reveals patterns and meaning. A simple way to organize qualitative data is to create a frequency distribution or relative frequency distribution. Both of these are tables which organize non‑numerical categories into groups and shows how often each category occurs.\n\nA **frequency distribution for qualitative data** is a table that lists each category with its corresponding frequency.\n\nA **relative frequency distribution for qualitative data** is a table that lists each category with its corresponding relative frequency. Relative frequencies can be in the form of a proportion or a percentage.\n\nThese displays of qualitative data help you quickly see which categories are most common, how the data is spread across different groups, and whether any categories stand out as unusually frequent or rare.\n\n::: {#exm-creating-a-frequency-and-relative-frequency-distribution}\n## Creating a Frequency and Relative Frequency Distribution\n\nData was collected for two semesters in a statistics class. @tbl-Class shows the variables and the first 6 rows of the data set.

There are several different graphs that are used for qualitative data. Typical qualitative graphs include bar graphs, Pareto charts, and pie charts. Bar graphs can be created using a statistical program like Rguroo.\n\n**Bar graphs or charts** consist of the frequencies on one axis and the categories on the other axis. Drawing the bar graph using Rguroo is performed by importing the dataset (or creating a dataset) and using the Plots toolbox in Rguroo.\n\n::: {#exm-drawing-a-bar-chart}\n## Drawing a Bar Chart \n\nUse the [class_survey1]{.data} to create a bar chart of vehicle type.\n\n:::\n\n\n**Solution**\n\nClick to expand the box below see how to create the bar graph for vehicle type.\n\n:::: {#Creating-Bar-Graph-of-Vehicle-Type-in-Rguroo .callout-note appearance=\"simple\" collapse=\"true\" icon=\"none\" title=\"![](Rguroo_Icons/R_circle_logo.svg){width=22px style='vertical-align:middle;'} Creating Bar Graph of Vehicle Type in Rguroo\"}\n\n**Before you begin:** Make sure you have already imported the [class_survey1]{.data} dataset into your Rguroo account, as was shown [here](#Importing-Class_Survey1-to-Rguroo).\n\n1.

Many types seems to be the lesser used, and tied for last place. However, more data would help to figure this out.\n\n**All graphs should have labels on each axis and a title for the graph.**\n\nThe beauty of data frames with multiple variables is that you can answer many questions from the data. Suppose you want to see if gender makes a difference for the type of car a person drives. If you are a car manufacturer, if you knew that certain genders like certain cars, then you would advertise to the different genders.\n\n::: {#exm-drawing-a-bar-chart-by-gender}\n## Drawing a Bar Chart of Vehicle Type by Gender\n\nUse the [class_survey1]{.data} to create a bar chart of vehicle type by gender.\n\n:::\n\n**Solution**\n\nClick to expand the box below see how to create the bar graph for vehicle type disaggreagated by gender.\n\n:::: {#Creating-Bar-Graph-of-Vehicle-Gender-in-Rguroo .callout-note appearance=\"simple\" collapse=\"true\" icon=\"none\" title=\"![](Rguroo_Icons/R_circle_logo.svg){width=22px style='vertical-align:middle;'} Creating Bar Graph of Vehicle Type and Gender in Rguroo\"}\n\n**Before you begin:** Make sure you have already imported the [class_survey1]{.data} dataset into your Rguroo account, as was shown [here](#Importing-Class_Survey1-to-Rguroo).\n\n1.

Obviously a larger sample would be needed to make any conclusions from this data.\n\nAnother version of a bar graph that is useful is a relative frequency bar graph. A relative frequency bar graph gives you a clear way to compare how different categories or values occur, especially when working with datasets of different sizes. By converting raw counts into proportions, the graph highlights patterns that might otherwise be hidden. This makes it a powerful tool for spotting meaningful relationships in data, comparing data of different sizes, and communicating those insights in a way that’s easy for others to understand.\n\nRguroo can generate a relative frequency bar graph from the same plot toolbox.\n\n::: {#exm-drawing-a-relative-frequency-bar-chart}\n## Drawing a Relative Frequency Bar Chart for Vehicle Type\n\nUse the [class_survey1]{.data} to create a relative frequency bar chart of vehicle type.\n\n:::\n\n**Solution**\n\nClick to expand the box below see how to create the relative frequency bar graph for vehicle type.\n\n:::: {#Creating-Relative-Frequency-Bar-Graph-of-Vehicle-in-Rguroo .callout-note appearance=\"simple\" collapse=\"true\" icon=\"none\" title=\"![](Rguroo_Icons/R_circle_logo.svg){width=22px style='vertical-align:middle;'} Creating Relative Frequency Bar Graph of Vehicle Type in Rguroo\"}\n\n**Before you begin:** Make sure you have already imported the [class_survey1]{.data} dataset into your Rguroo account, as was shown [here](#Importing-Class_Survey1-to-Rguroo).\n\n1.

However, most dataset values are varied where there are too many different data values and a regular frequency or relative frequeny distribution would be meaningless.\n\nFor quantitative data that is largely spread, we can group the data values into classes, also known as binning. When you group data into classes/bins, you create a **grouped frequency distribution**.\n\nLower and upper class limits define the boundaries of each class in a grouped frequency distribution. The **lower class limit** is the smallest value that can belong to a class, while the **upper class limit** is the largest value that can belong to that same class. Together, these limits specify exactly which data values fall into each interval. Most of the time, classes are displayed using interval notation.  For example, suppose we wanted to group the ages of students into a group from 20-25.  This could be displayed using interval notation, [20,25). This interval would capture every student whos age is 20 to 25 years, including 20 years old, but not 25 years old. These limits keep the classes organized, prevent overlap, and ensure every data point has a clear place within the distribution.\n\nEach class has a **class width**, the size of the class (or the number of values within each class).  If you have a grouped frequency distribution, the class width can be determined by subtracting two consecutive lower class limits.  \n\nRguroo has three automatic methods to calculate the number of bins; however, we will use Freedman–Diaconis since is usually the most reliable with messy real-world data.  Manual calculation of bins is also possible in Rguroo.\n\n::: {#exm-grouped-frequency-distribution}\n## Creating a Grouped Frequency Distribution\n\nUse the [class_survey1]{.data} to create a grouped frequency distribution for the distance a student lives from the Lone Tree Campus of Coconino Community College .\n\n:::\n\n**Solution**\n\nClick to expand the box below see how to create a grouped frequency distribution for distance to campus.\n\n:::: {#Creating-Grouped-Frequency-Distribution-of-Distance-in-Rguroo .callout-note appearance=\"simple\" collapse=\"true\" icon=\"none\" title=\"![](Rguroo_Icons/R_circle_logo.svg){width=22px style='vertical-align:middle;'} Creating Grouped Frequency Distribution in Rguroo\"}\n\n**Before you begin:** Make sure you have already imported the [class_survey1]{.data} dataset into your Rguroo account, as was shown [here](#Importing-Class_Survey1-to-Rguroo).\n\n1.

Each class has a class width of 5. Now that the data is organized, it is easily seen that most students live within 15 miles of campus. There are also two students who live farther from campus than the rest of the class.\n\n**Graphical Displays of Quantitative Data**\n\nThere are several different graphical displays for quantitative data. With quantitative data, you can talk about how the data is distributed, called a distribution. In addition, the shape of the distribution can be described from the graphs.\n\n**Histogram:** A graph of frequencies (counts) on the vertical axis and classes on the horizontal axis. The height of the rectangles is the frequency (or relative frequency) and the width of the rectangle is called the class width. The width depends on how many values (bins) are in the histogram. \n\n**Density Plot:** Similar to a histogram, except smoothing is created to smooth out the graph. The shape is not dependent on the number of bins so the distribution is easier to determine from the density plot.\n\n**Stem and Leaf Plot:** A graph that organizes numerical data by splitting each value into a \"stem\" (leading digit(s)) and a \"leaf\" (the last digit) to show data distribution, frequency, and shape.\n\n\n::: {#exm-drawing-a-histogram-density-plot}\n## Drawing Histogram and Density Plot for Distance from Campus\n\nData was collected for two semesters in a statistics class drive.

They all tell you similar ideas of the shape of the distribution. Reviewing the graphs you can see that most of the students live within 10 miles of the Lone Tree Campus, in fact most live within 5 miles from the campus. However, there is a student who lives around 50 miles from the Lone Tree Campus. This is a great deal farther from the rest of the data. This value could be considered an outlier.\n\nAn **outlier** is a data value that is far from the rest of the values. It may be an unusual value or a mistake. It is a data value that should be investigated. In this case, the student lived really far from campus, thus the value is not a mistake, and is just very unusual.\n\n\n### Shapes of the distribution:\n\nWhen you look at a distribution, look at the basic shape. There are some basic shapes that are seen in histograms. Realize though that some distributions have no shape. The common shapes are bell-shape, skewed, and uniform. Another interest is how many peaks a graph may have. This is known as modal.\n\nBell-shape means that you can fold the graph in half down the middle and the two sides will line up. You can think of the two sides as being mirror images of each other. Skewed means one \"tail\" of the graph is longer than the other. The graph is skewed in the direction of the longer tail (backwards from what you would expect). A uniform graph has all the bars the same height.\n\nModal refers to the number of peaks. Unimodal has one peak and bimodal has two peaks. Usually if a graph has more than two peaks, the modal information is not longer of interest.\n\nExamining the shape of a distribution gives you a deeper understanding of how your data behaves beyond simple averages or totals. The shape reveals patterns, such as whether values cluster tightly, spread out widely, lean to one side, or form multiple peaks. These aspect that can influence how you interpret results. By paying attention to features like symmetry, skewness, and unusual gaps or spikes, you gain insight into underlying trends, potential outliers, and the most appropriate statistical methods to use.\n\nOther important features to consider are how spread out is the data, and where the center of the graph is. These concepts will be explored in Chapter 3.\n\n### Examples of graphs:\n\n**Bell-Shape**\n\nThis graph is bell-shape:\n\n![Bell Shape Graph](Rguroo_outputs/Graphical_Description_of_Data/symmetric.png){width=60% fig-alt=\"one side looks like other\"}\n\nA bell-shape histogram has a balanced, mirror‑like appearance, with the bars rising to a peak near the center and then decreasing at roughly the same rate on both sides. The left and right halves of the distribution look similar in both height and spread, so if you folded the graph down the middle, the two sides would line up closely. There are no long tails pulling the shape in one direction, and the overall pattern often forms a smooth, mound‑shaped curve. Note that bell-shape doesn’t require perfect symmetry.\n\n**Bimodal**\n\nThis graph is bimodal:\n\n![Bimodal Graph](Rguroo_outputs/Graphical_Description_of_Data/bimodal_symmetric.png){width=60% fig-alt=\"two bars high, and one side looks like other\"}\n\nA bimodal histogram has two distinct peaks, meaning the bars rise to form one cluster of high values, dip down in the middle, and then rise again to form a second cluster.  Visually, the histogram looks like a pair of hills or humps separated by a noticeable valley. In this histogram, the overall shape is symmetric; however, this is not a requirement for a bimodal graph. In addition, the separation between the peaks can be sharp or gradual.\n\n**Skewed Right**\n\nThis graph is skewed to the right:\n\n![Skewed Right Graph](Rguroo_outputs/Graphical_Description_of_Data/skewed_right.png){width=60% fig-alt=\"small bars on right\"}\n\nA skewed right histogram has most of its highest bars on the left side, with the heights tapering off gradually as you move to the right. The bulk of the data forms a tall block on the left, while a long, stretched‑out tail extends as you move right.The most frequently occuring data sits closer to the left, and the right tail is noticeably longer and thinner than the left.\n\n**Graph: Skewed Left Distribution**\n\nThis graph is skewed to the left:\n\n![Skewed Left Graph](Rguroo_outputs/Graphical_Description_of_Data/skewed_left2.png){width=60% fig-alt=\"small bars on left\"}\n\nA skewed left histogram has most of its highest bars on the right side, with the heights tapering off gradually as you move to the left. The bulk of the data forms a tall block on the right, while a long, stretched‑out tail extends as you move left.The most frequently occuring data sits closer to the right, and the left tail is noticeably longer and thinner than the left.\n\n**Uniform Distribution**\n\nThis graph is uniform:\n\n![Uniform Graph](Rguroo_outputs/Graphical_Description_of_Data/uniform.png){width=60% fig-alt=\"All bars same height\"}\n\nA uniform histogram has bars that are all roughly the same height, giving the graph a flat, even appearance across the entire range of values. No single interval stands out as especially common or rare; instead, the data are spread evenly, with each bar occurring at about the same frequency. Visually, it looks like a row of nearly level rectangles, without peaks, clusters, or noticeable patterns. Note that the graph above is perfectly uniform (all heights of the bars are equal); however, this is not a requirement to be uniform. \n\n::: {#exm-drawing-a-histogram-density-plot-tuition}\n## Drawing Histogram and Density Plot for Tuition\n\nData was collected from the Chronicle of Higher Education for tuition from public four year colleges, private four year colleges, and for profit four year colleges.

Some of the more common ones are the point plot (scatter plot), and a time-series plot. There are also many different graphs that have emerged lately for qualitative data. Many are found in publications and websites. The following is a description of the point plot (scatter plot), and the time-series plot.\n\n### Point Plots or Scatter Plot\n\nSometimes you have two different variables and you want to see if they are related in any way. A scatter plot helps you to see what the relationship would look like. A scatter plot is plotting the ordered pairs on the cartesian coordinate system (x-y axis).\n\n::: {#exm-scatter-plot}\n## Creating a Scatter Plot\n\nData was collected from a sleep study conducted on college students.

For example, a time-series plot is used to show profits over the last 5 years.\n\nThe purpose of a time-series graph is to look for trends over time. Caution, you must realize that the trend may not continue. Just because you see an increase, doesn't mean the increase will continue forever. As an example, prior to 2007, many people noticed that housing prices were increasing. The belief at the time was that housing prices would continue to increase. However, the housing bubble burst in 2007, and many houses lost value, and haven't recovered.\n\n::: {#exm-time-series}\n## Creating a Time Series Plot\n\nThe first 6 rows of bank assets (in billions of Australia dollars (AUD)) of the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) and other financial organizations for the time period of September 1 1969, through March 1 2019, are contained in table @tbl-Australian (Reserve Bank of Australia, 2019).

If the vertical axis doesn't start at 0, then the change can look much more dramatic than it really is. For a graph to be useful to the reader, it needs to have a title that explains what the graph contains, the axes should be labeled so the reader knows what each axes represents, each axes should have a scale marked, and it is best if the vertical axis contains 0 to show the relationship.\n\n### Homework for Other Graphical Representations of Data Section\n\n1.

Remember, in most cases you can't collect the entire population, so you have to take a sample. Thus, you collect data either through a sample or a census. Now you have a large number of data values. What can you do with them? No one likes to look at just a set of numbers. One thing is to organize the data into a table or graph. Ultimately though, you want to be able to use that graph to interpret the data, to describe the distribution of the data set, and to explore different characteristics of the data. The characteristics that will be discussed in this chapter and the next chapter are:\n\n1.  Center: middle of the data set, also known as the average.\n2.  Variation: how much the data varies.\n3.  Distribution: shape of the data (symmetric, uniform, or skewed).\n4.  Qualitative data: analysis of the data\n5.  Outliers: data values that are far from the majority of the data.\n6.  Time: changing characteristics of the data over time.\n\nThis chapter will focus on organizing data, creating graphs of the data, and using the graphs to understand aspects of the data.\n\nThis textbook uses Rguroo to perform all graphical and descriptive statistics, and all statistical inference. When using Rguroo, you will need to either import a dataset from a repository or create a dataset. For directions on how to create a dataset in Rguroo, please refer to Chapter 0.\n\n```{r setup2, include=FALSE,echo=FALSE}\nlibrary(\"mosaicCore\") \nlibrary(\"mosaic\") \n#library(\"NHANES\") \nlibrary(\"Lock5Data\")\n```\n\n## Qualitative Data\n\nRemember, qualitative data are words describing a characteristic of the individual. Once you’ve gathered raw data, the real work begins. A long list of observations doesn’t tell you much on its own. Raw data is usually messy, unstructured, and difficult to understand or use. The next step is to organize the data in a way that reveals patterns and meaning. A simple way to organize qualitative data is to create a frequency distribution or relative frequency distribution. Both of these are tables which organize non‑numerical categories into groups and shows how often each category occurs.\n\nA **frequency distribution for qualitative data** is a table that lists each category with its corresponding frequency.\n\nA **relative frequency distribution for qualitative data** is a table that lists each category with its corresponding relative frequency. Relative frequencies can be in the form of a proportion or a percentage.\n\nThese displays of qualitative data help you quickly see which categories are most common, how the data is spread across different groups, and whether any categories stand out as unusually frequent or rare.\n\n::: {#exm-creating-a-frequency-and-relative-frequency-distribution}\n## Creating a Frequency and Relative Frequency Distribution\n\nData was collected for two semesters in a statistics class. @tbl-Class shows the variables and the first 6 rows of the data set.

There are several different graphs that are used for qualitative data. Typical qualitative graphs include bar graphs, Pareto charts, and pie charts. Bar graphs can be created using a statistical program like Rguroo.\n\n**Bar graphs or charts** consist of the frequencies on one axis and the categories on the other axis. Drawing the bar graph using Rguroo is performed by importing the dataset (or creating a dataset) and using the Plots toolbox in Rguroo.\n\n::: {#exm-drawing-a-bar-chart}\n## Drawing a Bar Chart \n\nUse the [class_survey1]{.data} to create a bar chart of vehicle type.\n\n:::\n\n\n**Solution**\n\nClick to expand the box below see how to create the bar graph for vehicle type.\n\n:::: {#Creating-Bar-Graph-of-Vehicle-Type-in-Rguroo .callout-note appearance=\"simple\" collapse=\"true\" icon=\"none\" title=\"![](Rguroo_Icons/R_circle_logo.svg){width=22px style='vertical-align:middle;'} Creating Bar Graph of Vehicle Type in Rguroo\"}\n\n**Before you begin:** Make sure you have already imported the [class_survey1]{.data} dataset into your Rguroo account, as was shown [here](#Importing-Class_Survey1-to-Rguroo).\n\n1.

Many types seems to be the lesser used, and tied for last place. However, more data would help to figure this out.\n\n**All graphs should have labels on each axis and a title for the graph.**\n\nThe beauty of data frames with multiple variables is that you can answer many questions from the data. Suppose you want to see if gender makes a difference for the type of car a person drives. If you are a car manufacturer, if you knew that certain genders like certain cars, then you would advertise to the different genders.\n\n::: {#exm-drawing-a-bar-chart-by-gender}\n## Drawing a Bar Chart of Vehicle Type by Gender\n\nUse the [class_survey1]{.data} to create a bar chart of vehicle type by gender.\n\n:::\n\n**Solution**\n\nClick to expand the box below see how to create the bar graph for vehicle type disaggreagated by gender.\n\n:::: {#Creating-Bar-Graph-of-Vehicle-Gender-in-Rguroo .callout-note appearance=\"simple\" collapse=\"true\" icon=\"none\" title=\"![](Rguroo_Icons/R_circle_logo.svg){width=22px style='vertical-align:middle;'} Creating Bar Graph of Vehicle Type and Gender in Rguroo\"}\n\n**Before you begin:** Make sure you have already imported the [class_survey1]{.data} dataset into your Rguroo account, as was shown [here](#Importing-Class_Survey1-to-Rguroo).\n\n1.

Obviously a larger sample would be needed to make any conclusions from this data.\n\nAnother version of a bar graph that is useful is a relative frequency bar graph. A relative frequency bar graph gives you a clear way to compare how different categories or values occur, especially when working with datasets of different sizes. By converting raw counts into proportions, the graph highlights patterns that might otherwise be hidden. This makes it a powerful tool for spotting meaningful relationships in data, comparing data of different sizes, and communicating those insights in a way that’s easy for others to understand.\n\nRguroo can generate a relative frequency bar graph from the same plot toolbox.\n\n::: {#exm-drawing-a-relative-frequency-bar-chart}\n## Drawing a Relative Frequency Bar Chart for Vehicle Type\n\nUse the [class_survey1]{.data} to create a relative frequency bar chart of vehicle type.\n\n:::\n\n**Solution**\n\nClick to expand the box below see how to create the relative frequency bar graph for vehicle type.\n\n:::: {#Creating-Relative-Frequency-Bar-Graph-of-Vehicle-in-Rguroo .callout-note appearance=\"simple\" collapse=\"true\" icon=\"none\" title=\"![](Rguroo_Icons/R_circle_logo.svg){width=22px style='vertical-align:middle;'} Creating Relative Frequency Bar Graph of Vehicle Type in Rguroo\"}\n\n**Before you begin:** Make sure you have already imported the [class_survey1]{.data} dataset into your Rguroo account, as was shown [here](#Importing-Class_Survey1-to-Rguroo).\n\n1.

However, most dataset values are varied where there are too many different data values and a regular frequency or relative frequeny distribution would be meaningless.\n\nFor quantitative data that is largely spread, we can group the data values into classes, also known as binning. When you group data into classes/bins, you create a **grouped frequency distribution**.\n\nLower and upper class limits define the boundaries of each class in a grouped frequency distribution. The **lower class limit** is the smallest value that can belong to a class, while the **upper class limit** is the largest value that can belong to that same class. Together, these limits specify exactly which data values fall into each interval. Most of the time, classes are displayed using interval notation.  For example, suppose we wanted to group the ages of students into a group from 20-25.  This could be displayed using interval notation, [20,25). This interval would capture every student whos age is 20 to 25 years, including 20 years old, but not 25 years old. These limits keep the classes organized, prevent overlap, and ensure every data point has a clear place within the distribution.\n\nEach class has a **class width**, the size of the class (or the number of values within each class).  If you have a grouped frequency distribution, the class width can be determined by subtracting two consecutive lower class limits.  \n\nRguroo has three automatic methods to calculate the number of bins; however, we will use Freedman–Diaconis since is usually the most reliable with messy real-world data.  Manual calculation of bins is also possible in Rguroo.\n\n::: {#exm-grouped-frequency-distribution}\n## Creating a Grouped Frequency Distribution\n\nUse the [class_survey1]{.data} to create a grouped frequency distribution for the distance a student lives from the Lone Tree Campus of Coconino Community College .\n\n:::\n\n**Solution**\n\nClick to expand the box below see how to create a grouped frequency distribution for distance to campus.\n\n:::: {#Creating-Grouped-Frequency-Distribution-of-Distance-in-Rguroo .callout-note appearance=\"simple\" collapse=\"true\" icon=\"none\" title=\"![](Rguroo_Icons/R_circle_logo.svg){width=22px style='vertical-align:middle;'} Creating Grouped Frequency Distribution in Rguroo\"}\n\n**Before you begin:** Make sure you have already imported the [class_survey1]{.data} dataset into your Rguroo account, as was shown [here](#Importing-Class_Survey1-to-Rguroo).\n\n1.

Each class has a class width of 5. Now that the data is organized, it is easily seen that most students live within 15 miles of campus. There are also two students who live farther from campus than the rest of the class.\n\n**Graphical Displays of Quantitative Data**\n\nThere are several different graphical displays for quantitative data. With quantitative data, you can talk about how the data is distributed, called a distribution. In addition, the shape of the distribution can be described from the graphs.\n\n**Histogram:** A graph of frequencies (counts) on the vertical axis and classes on the horizontal axis. The height of the rectangles is the frequency (or relative frequency) and the width of the rectangle is called the class width. The width depends on how many values (bins) are in the histogram. \n\n**Density Plot:** Similar to a histogram, except smoothing is created to smooth out the graph. The shape is not dependent on the number of bins so the distribution is easier to determine from the density plot.\n\n**Stem and Leaf Plot:** A graph that organizes numerical data by splitting each value into a \"stem\" (leading digit(s)) and a \"leaf\" (the last digit) to show data distribution, frequency, and shape.\n\n\n::: {#exm-drawing-a-histogram-density-plot}\n## Drawing Histogram and Density Plot for Distance from Campus\n\nData was collected for two semesters in a statistics class drive.

They all tell you similar ideas of the shape of the distribution. Reviewing the graphs you can see that most of the students live within 10 miles of the Lone Tree Campus, in fact most live within 5 miles from the campus. However, there is a student who lives around 50 miles from the Lone Tree Campus. This is a great deal farther from the rest of the data. This value could be considered an outlier.\n\nAn **outlier** is a data value that is far from the rest of the values. It may be an unusual value or a mistake. It is a data value that should be investigated. In this case, the student lived really far from campus, thus the value is not a mistake, and is just very unusual.\n\n\n### Shapes of the distribution:\n\nWhen you look at a distribution, look at the basic shape. There are some basic shapes that are seen in histograms. Realize though that some distributions have no shape. The common shapes are bell-shape, skewed, and uniform. Another interest is how many peaks a graph may have. This is known as modal.\n\nBell-shape means that you can fold the graph in half down the middle and the two sides will line up. You can think of the two sides as being mirror images of each other. Skewed means one \"tail\" of the graph is longer than the other. The graph is skewed in the direction of the longer tail (backwards from what you would expect). A uniform graph has all the bars the same height.\n\nModal refers to the number of peaks. Unimodal has one peak and bimodal has two peaks. Usually if a graph has more than two peaks, the modal information is not longer of interest.\n\nExamining the shape of a distribution gives you a deeper understanding of how your data behaves beyond simple averages or totals. The shape reveals patterns, such as whether values cluster tightly, spread out widely, lean to one side, or form multiple peaks. These aspect that can influence how you interpret results. By paying attention to features like symmetry, skewness, and unusual gaps or spikes, you gain insight into underlying trends, potential outliers, and the most appropriate statistical methods to use.\n\nOther important features to consider are how spread out is the data, and where the center of the graph is. These concepts will be explored in Chapter 3.\n\n### Examples of graphs:\n\n**Bell-Shape**\n\nThis graph is bell-shape:\n\n![Bell Shape Graph](Rguroo_outputs/Graphical_Description_of_Data/symmetric.png){width=60% fig-alt=\"one side looks like other\"}\n\nA bell-shape histogram has a balanced, mirror‑like appearance, with the bars rising to a peak near the center and then decreasing at roughly the same rate on both sides. The left and right halves of the distribution look similar in both height and spread, so if you folded the graph down the middle, the two sides would line up closely. There are no long tails pulling the shape in one direction, and the overall pattern often forms a smooth, mound‑shaped curve. Note that bell-shape doesn’t require perfect symmetry.\n\n**Bimodal**\n\nThis graph is bimodal:\n\n![Bimodal Graph](Rguroo_outputs/Graphical_Description_of_Data/bimodal_symmetric.png){width=60% fig-alt=\"two bars high, and one side looks like other\"}\n\nA bimodal histogram has two distinct peaks, meaning the bars rise to form one cluster of high values, dip down in the middle, and then rise again to form a second cluster.  Visually, the histogram looks like a pair of hills or humps separated by a noticeable valley. In this histogram, the overall shape is symmetric; however, this is not a requirement for a bimodal graph. In addition, the separation between the peaks can be sharp or gradual.\n\n**Skewed Right**\n\nThis graph is skewed to the right:\n\n![Skewed Right Graph](Rguroo_outputs/Graphical_Description_of_Data/skewed_right.png){width=60% fig-alt=\"small bars on right\"}\n\nA skewed right histogram has most of its highest bars on the left side, with the heights tapering off gradually as you move to the right. The bulk of the data forms a tall block on the left, while a long, stretched‑out tail extends as you move right.The most frequently occuring data sits closer to the left, and the right tail is noticeably longer and thinner than the left.\n\n**Graph: Skewed Left Distribution**\n\nThis graph is skewed to the left:\n\n![Skewed Left Graph](Rguroo_outputs/Graphical_Description_of_Data/skewed_left2.png){width=60% fig-alt=\"small bars on left\"}\n\nA skewed left histogram has most of its highest bars on the right side, with the heights tapering off gradually as you move to the left. The bulk of the data forms a tall block on the right, while a long, stretched‑out tail extends as you move left.The most frequently occuring data sits closer to the right, and the left tail is noticeably longer and thinner than the left.\n\n**Uniform Distribution**\n\nThis graph is uniform:\n\n![Uniform Graph](Rguroo_outputs/Graphical_Description_of_Data/uniform.png){width=60% fig-alt=\"All bars same height\"}\n\nA uniform histogram has bars that are all roughly the same height, giving the graph a flat, even appearance across the entire range of values. No single interval stands out as especially common or rare; instead, the data are spread evenly, with each bar occurring at about the same frequency. Visually, it looks like a row of nearly level rectangles, without peaks, clusters, or noticeable patterns. Note that the graph above is perfectly uniform (all heights of the bars are equal); however, this is not a requirement to be uniform. \n\n::: {#exm-drawing-a-histogram-density-plot-tuition}\n## Drawing Histogram and Density Plot for Tuition\n\nData was collected from the Chronicle of Higher Education for tuition from public four year colleges, private four year colleges, and for profit four year colleges.

Some of the more common ones are the point plot (scatter plot), and a time-series plot. There are also many different graphs that have emerged lately for qualitative data. Many are found in publications and websites. The following is a description of the point plot (scatter plot), and the time-series plot.\n\n### Point Plots or Scatter Plot\n\nSometimes you have two different variables and you want to see if they are related in any way. A scatter plot helps you to see what the relationship would look like. A scatter plot is plotting the ordered pairs on the cartesian coordinate system (x-y axis).\n\n::: {#exm-scatter-plot}\n## Creating a Scatter Plot\n\nData was collected from a sleep study conducted on college students.

For example, a time-series plot is used to show profits over the last 5 years.\n\nThe purpose of a time-series graph is to look for trends over time. Caution, you must realize that the trend may not continue. Just because you see an increase, doesn't mean the increase will continue forever. As an example, prior to 2007, many people noticed that housing prices were increasing. The belief at the time was that housing prices would continue to increase. However, the housing bubble burst in 2007, and many houses lost value, and haven't recovered.\n\n::: {#exm-time-series}\n## Creating a Time Series Plot\n\nThe first 6 rows of bank assets (in billions of Australia dollars (AUD)) of the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) and other financial organizations for the time period of September 1 1969, through March 1 2019, are contained in table @tbl-Australian (Reserve Bank of Australia, 2019).

If the vertical axis doesn't start at 0, then the change can look much more dramatic than it really is. For a graph to be useful to the reader, it needs to have a title that explains what the graph contains, the axes should be labeled so the reader knows what each axes represents, each axes should have a scale marked, and it is best if the vertical axis contains 0 to show the relationship.\n\n### Homework for Other Graphical Representations of Data Section\n\n1.
