One is used to determine significant relationship between two qualitative variables, the second is used to determine if the sample data has a particular distribution, and the last is used to determine significant relationships between means of 3 or more samples.\n\n## Chi-Square Test for Independence\n\nRemember, qualitative data is where you collect data on individuals that are categories or names. Then you would count how many of the individuals had particular qualities. An example is that there is a theory that there is a relationship between breastfeeding and autism. To determine if there is a relationship, researchers could collect the time period that a mother breastfed her child and if that child was diagnosed with autism. Then you would have a table containing this information. Now you want to know if each cell is independent of each other cell. Remember, independence says that one event does not affect another event. Here it means that having autism is independent of being breastfed. What you really want is to see if they are not independent. In other words, does one affect the other? If you were to do a hypothesis test, this is your alternative hypothesis and the null hypothesis is that they are independent. There is a hypothesis test for this and it is called the **Chi-Square Test for Independence**. Technically it should be called the Chi-Square Test for Dependence, but for historical reasons it is known as the test for independence. Just as with previous hypothesis tests, all the steps are the same except for the conditions and the test statistic.\n\n### Hypothesis Test for Chi-Square Test\n\n1.  State the null and alternative hypotheses and the level of significance\n\n$H_o:$ the two variables are independent (this means that the one variable is not affected by the other)\n\n$H_a:$ the two variables are dependent (this means that the one variable is affected by the other)\n\nAlso, state your $\\alpha$ level here.\n\n2.  State and check the conditions for the hypothesis test\n\n<!-- -->\n\na.  State: A random sample is taken. Check: describe the process used to collect sample.\n\nb.  State: Expected frequencies for each cell are greater than or equal to 5, which means $E\\ge5$. Check: The expected frequencies, $E$, will be calculated later.\n\n3\\. Find the test statistic and p-value\n\nFinding the test statistic involves several steps. First the data is collected and counted, and then it is organized into a table (in a table each entry is called a cell). These values are known as the observed frequencies, which the symbol for an observed frequency is $O$. Each table is made up of rows and columns. Then each row is totaled to give a row total and each column is totaled to give a column total.\n\nThe null hypothesis is that the variables are independent. Using the multiplication rule for independent events you can calculate the probability of being one value of the first variable, $A$, and one value of the second variable, $B$ (the probability of a particular cell). Remember in a hypothesis test, you assume that is true, the two variables are assumed to be independent.\n\nNow you want to find out how many individuals you expect to be in a certain cell. To find the expected frequencies, you just need to multiply the probability of that cell times the total number of individuals. Do not round the expected frequencies.\n\nIf the variables are independent the expected frequencies and the observed frequencies should be the same. The test statistic here will involve looking at the difference between the expected frequency and the observed frequency for each cell. Then you want to find the \"total difference\" of all of these differences. The larger the total, the smaller the chances that you could find that test statistic given that the condition of independence is true. That means that the condition of independence is not true. How do you find the test statistic? First find the differences between the observed and expected frequencies. Because some of these differences will be positive and some will be negative, you need to square these differences. These squares could be large just because the frequencies are large, you need to divide by the expected frequencies to scale them. Then finally add up all of these fractional values. This is the test statistic.\n\nTest Statistic:\n\nUsing r: See [Example: Hypothesis Test with Chi-Square Test] for the process\n\n4.  Conclusion\n\nThis is where you write reject $H_o$ or fail to reject $H_o$. The rule is: if the p-value $<\\alpha$, then reject $H_o$. If the p-value$\\ge \\alpha$, then fail to reject $H_o$\n\n5.  Interpretation\n\nThis is where you interpret in real world terms the conclusion to the test. The conclusion for a hypothesis test is that you either have enough evidence to support $H_a$, or you do not have enough evidence to support $H_a$.\n\n#### Example: Hypothesis Test with Chi-Square Test\n\nIs there a relationship between autism and breastfeeding? To determine if there is, a researcher asked mothers of autistic and non-autistic children to say what time period they breastfed their children. The data is in [Autism Versus Breastfeeding] (Schultz, Klonoff-Cohen, Wingard, Askhoomoff, Macera, Ji & Bacher, 2006). Do the data provide enough evidence to support that breastfeeding and autism are independent? Test at the 1% level.\n\n##### Autism Versus Breastfeeding\n\n| Autism | Not Breast Feed | Breast Feed less than 2 months | Breast Feed 2 to 6 months | Breast Feed more than 6 months |\n|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n| yes    | 241             | 198                            | 164                       | 215                            |\n| no     | 20              | 25                             | 27                        | 44                             |\n\n: Breast Feeding\n\nTo put this data into r, use the following commands:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nIf you have the data frame instead of the summary table as in this example, you can use the tally command to create the table in r. Just save the tally command with a name.\n\n#### Solution\n\n1.  State the null and alternative hypotheses and the level of significance\n\n$H_o$: Breastfeeding and autism are independent\n\n$H_a$: Breastfeeding and autism are dependent\n\n2.  State and check the conditions for the hypothesis test\n\n<!-- -->\n\na.  State: A random sample of breastfeeding time frames and autism incidence was taken. Check: this was stated in the problem.\n\nb.  State: Expected frequencies for each cell are greater than or equal to 5, $E\\ge 5$. Check: See step 3. All expected frequencies are more than 5.\n\n<!-- -->\n\n3.  Find the test statistic and p-value On rStudio, the command is\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nchisq.test(autism_table) #calculates the test statistics and p-value \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\n\tPearson's Chi-squared test\n\ndata:  autism_table\nX-squared = 11.217, df = 3, p-value = 0.01061\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nchisq.test(autism_table)$expected # shows all the expected frequencies \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n         [,1]      [,2]      [,3]      [,4]\nyes 228.58458 195.30407 167.27837 226.83298\nno   32.41542  27.69593  23.72163  32.16702\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe test statistic is 11.217 and the p-value is 0.01061.\n\n4.  Conclusion\n\nFail to reject $H_o$ since the p-value is more than 0.01.\n\n5.  Interpretation\n\nThere is not enough evidence to support that breastfeeding and autism are dependent. This means that you cannot say whether a child is breastfed or not will indicate if that the child will be diagnosed with autism.\n\n### Homework for Chi-Square Test for Independence Section\n\n**In each problem show all steps of the hypothesis test.

There are times when it is important to determine how well the experimental values match the theoretical values. An example of this is if you wish to verify if a die is fair. To determine if observed values fit the expected values, you want to see if the difference between observed values and expected values is large enough to say that the test statistic is unlikely to happen if you assume that the observed values fit the expected values. The test statistic in this case is also the chi-square. The process is the same as for the chi-square test for independence.\n\n### Hypothesis Test for Goodness of Fit Test\n\n1.  State the null and alternative hypotheses and the level of significance\n\n$H_o:$ The data are consistent with a specific distribution\n\n$H_a:$ The data are not consistent with a specific distribution\n\nAlso, state your $\\alpha$ level here.\n\n2.

Interpretation\n\nThis is where you interpret in real world terms the conclusion to the test. The conclusion for a hypothesis test is that you either have enough evidence to support $H_a$, or you do not have enough evidence to support $H_a$.\n\n### Example: Goodness of Fit Test\n\nSuppose you have a die that you are curious if it is fair or not. If it is fair then the proportion for each value should be the same. You need to find the observed frequencies and to accomplish this you roll the die 500 times and count how often each side comes up. The data is in table @tbl-Die.

The problem with that is that your chance for a type I error increases. Instead you need a process for analyzing all of them at the same time. This process is known as **analysis of variance (ANOVA)**. The test statistic for the ANOVA is fairly complicated, you will want to use technology to find the test statistic and p-value. The test statistic is distributed as an F-distribution, which is skewed right and depends on degrees of freedom. Since you will use technology to find these, the distribution and the test statistic will not be presented. Remember, all hypothesis tests are the same process. Note that to obtain a statistically significant result there need only be a difference between any two of the $k$ means.\n\nBefore conducting the hypothesis test, it is helpful to look at the means and standard deviations for each data set. If the sample means with consideration of the sample standard deviations are different, it may mean that some of the population means are different. However, do realize that if they are different, it doesn't provide enough evidence to show the population means are different. Calculating the sample statistics just gives you an idea that conducting the hypothesis test is a good idea.\n\n### Hypothesis test using ANOVA to compare $k$ means\n\n1.  State the random variables and the parameters in words\n\n2.  State the null and alternative hypotheses and the level of significance\n\n$H_o:$ all the means are the same\n\n$H_a:$ at least two of the means are different\n\nAlso, state your $\\alpha$ level here.\n\n3.  State and check the conditions for the hypothesis test\n\na\\. State: A random sample of size is taken from each population. Check: discuss how the samples were taken.\n\nb.  State: All the samples are independent of each other. Check: Discuss how they are all independent.\n\nc.  State: Each population is normally distributed. Check: Create density plots and normal quantile plot of each sample. Note: the ANOVA test is fairly robust to the condition especially if the sample sizes are fairly close to each other. Unless the populations are really not normally distributed and the sample sizes are close to each other, then this is a loose condition.\n\nd.  State: The population variances are all equal. Check: See if the sample variances are close to each other. If the sample sizes are close to each other, then this is a loose condition.\n\n4\\. Find the test statistic and p-value\n\nThe test statistic is $F$. To find the test statistic, use technology such r Studio.\n\nThe test statistic, $F$, is distributed as an F-distribution, where both degrees of freedom are needed in this distribution. The p-value is also calculated r Studio.\n\n5.  Conclusion\n\nThis is where you write reject $H_O$ or fail to reject $H_O$. The rule is: if the p-value $<\\alpha$, then reject $H_o$. If the p-value $\\ge \\alpha$, then fail to reject $H_o$\n\n6.  Interpretation\n\nThis is where you interpret in real world terms the conclusion to the test. The conclusion for a hypothesis test is that you either have enough evidence to support $H_a$, or you do not have enough evidence to support $H_a$.\n\nIf you do in fact reject $H_o$, then you know that at least two of the means are different. The next question you might ask is which are different? You can look at the sample means, but realize that these only give a preliminary result. To actually determine which means are different, you need to conduct other tests. Some of these tests are the range test, multiple comparison tests, Duncan test, Student-Newman-Keuls test, Tukey test, Scheffé test, Dunnett test, least significant different test, and the Bonferroni test. There is no consensus on which test to use.\n\n### Example: Hypothesis Test Involving Several Means\n\nCancer is a terrible disease. Surviving may depend on the type of cancer the person has. To see if the mean survival time for several types of cancer are different, data was collected on the survival time in days of patients with one of these cancer in advanced stage. The data is in @tbl-Cancer (\"Cancer survival story,\" 2013). (Please realize that this data is from 1978. There have been many advances in cancer treatment, so do not use this data as an indication of survival rates from these cancers.) Do the data indicate that at least two of the mean survival time for these types of cancer are not all equal?
